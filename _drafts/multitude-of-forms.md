## The multitude of forms

You can read part one of this essay [here](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/05/21/single-text-many-masters.html).


While composing for a wide array of audiences is in itself difficult,
source code also presents the challenge of composing multiple forms
simultaneously. Source code can inhabit multiple spaces simultaneously,
and they all must be developed in balance with one another.

### Code versus Data

> The progression of the Lisp programmer: the newbie realizes that the
difference between code and data is trivial. The expert realizes that
all code is data. And the true master realizes that all data is code.

> - Unknown



### Source versus binary

> Unity can only be manifested by the Binary. Unity itself and the idea of
> Unity are already two.
> 
> - Buddha


### Polyglot

> The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler.
> 
> The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.
> 
> Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.
> 
> But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.
> 
> - The Tao of Programming



### The Temporal dimension

> The authenticity of a thing is the essence of all that is
> transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its substative duration
> to its testimony to the history which it has experienced.
> 
> - Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
> Reproduction"

### Integrating copies

> Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one
> element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the
> place where it happens to be.
> 
> - Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
> Reproduction"


### Multiple representations

> Q: If only you and dead people understand hexidecimal, how many people
> understand hexidecimal?
> 
> A: 57006.

git vs html vs text files

### Previous versions and backporting

> Software is like sex; make one mistake, and you'll be supporting it
> for the next 18 years.

> - Unknown

### Levels of abstraction

> William James, father of American psychology, tells of meeting an old lady
> who told him the Earth rested on the back of a huge turtle. "But, my dear
> lady", Professor James asked, as politely as possible, "what holds up the
> turtle?" "Ah", she said, "that's easy. He is standing on the back of another
> turtle." "Oh, I see", said Professor James, still being polite. "But would
> you be so good as to tell me what holds up the second turtle?" "It's no use,
> Professor", said the old lady, realizing he was trying to lead her into a
> logical trap. "It's turtles-turtles-turtles, all the way!"
> 
> Prometheus Rising
