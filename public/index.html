  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day, I was working on some Cucumber features for a project, and I
discovered a neat technique that helps you to write better Cucumber steps.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to be <a href="http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong">cuking it wrong</a>,
but what does that really mean? Here&#8217;s Jonas&#8217; prescription:</p>

<blockquote><p>A step description should never contain regexen, CSS or XPath selectors, any<br/>kind of code or data structure. It should be easily understood just by reading<br/>the description.</p></blockquote>


<p>Great. Let&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/25/thoughtworks_req_manage/">pop the why stack</a>
a few times, shall we?</p>

<p><strong>Q1</strong>: Why do we want to have descriptions not use regexen, CSS selectors, or code?<br/>
<strong>A1</strong>: To give it a simpler language.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong>: Why do we want it to be in a simpler language?<br />
<strong>A2</strong>: So that it&#8217;s easily understandable for stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Q3</strong>: Why do we want it to be easily understandable for stakeholders?<br />
<strong>A3</strong>: Because then we can share a <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132">common language</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q4</strong>: Why is a common language important?<br />
<strong>A4</strong>: A shared language assists in making sure our model matches the desires of our stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Q5</strong>: Why do we want to match the desires of our stakeholders?<br />
<strong>A5</strong>: That&#8217;s the whole reason we&#8217;re on this project in the first place!</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s really all about: developing that common language.
Cukes should be written in that common language so that we can make sure we&#8217;re
on track. So fine: common language. Awesome. Let&#8217;s do this.</p>

<h2>Write some cukes in common language</h2>

<p>Time to write a cuke:</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
<span class='line'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>Scenario: Editing the home page
</div><div class='line'>  Given I'm logged in as an administrator
</div><div class='line'>  When I go to the home page
</div><div class='line'>  And I choose to edit the article
</div><div class='line'>  And I fill in some content
</div><div class='line'>  And I save it
</div><div class='line'>  Then I should see that content</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Basic CMS style stuff. I&#8217;m not going to argue that this is the best cuke in the
world, but it&#8217;s pretty good. What I want to do is examine some of these steps
in more detail. How would you implement these steps?</p>

<figure role=code><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>

<span class='line'>13</span>
<span class='line'>14</span>
<span class='line'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='ruby'><div class='line'><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /^I choose to edit the article$/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</div><div class='line'>  <span class="n">pending</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /^I fill in some content$/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</div><div class='line'>  <span class="n">pending</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /^I save it$/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</div><div class='line'>  <span class="n">pending</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'><span class="no">Then</span><span class="sr"> /^I should see that content$/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</div><div class='line'>  <span class="n">pending</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Go ahead. Write them down somewhere. I&#8217;ll wait.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>&#8230; done yet?</p>

<br /><br /><br /><br />


<h2>Implementing a step</h2>

<p>Done? Okay! Before I show you my implementation, let&#8217;s talk about this step:</p>

<figure role=code><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='ruby'><div class='line'><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /^I choose to edit the article$/</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When writing this step, I realized something. When trying to write steps like
these, there&#8217;s a danger in tying them too closely to your specific HTML. It&#8217;s
why many people don&#8217;t write view tests: they&#8217;re brittle. I actually like view
tests, but that&#8217;s another blog post. Point is this: we know we&#8217;re going to
follow a link, and we know that we want that link to go somewhere that will
let us edit the article. We don&#8217;t really care <em>where</em> it is in the DOM, just
that somewhere, we&#8217;ve got an &#8216;edit article&#8217; link. How to pull this off?</p>

<h3>First idea: id attribute</h3>

<p>You might be thinking &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it an id attribute!&#8221; Here&#8217;s the problem with
that: ids have to be unique, per page. With article editing, that might not be
a problem, but it&#8217;s certainly not a general solution. So that&#8217;s out.</p>

<h3>Second time: class attribute</h3>

<p>&#8220;Okay, then just use a class. Your blog sucks.&#8221; Well, let&#8217;s check out what
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#classes">the HTML5 spec says about classes</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Basically nothing about semantics.</p></blockquote>


<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s paraphrased. But still, the spec basically says some stuff
about the details of implementing classes, but absolutely nothing about the
semantics of a class. In practice, classes are largely used for styling
purposes. We don&#8217;t want to conflate our styling with our data, so overloading
class for this purpose might work, but feels kinda wrong.</p>

<h3>What about the text?</h3>

<p>We could match on the text of the link. After all, that&#8217;s what people use to
determine what links to click on. The link with the text &#8220;Edit this post&#8221; lets
us know that that link will let us edit a post.</p>

<p>Matching on the text is brittle, though. What happens when marketing comes
through and changes the text to read &#8220;Edit my post&#8221;? Our tests break. Ugh.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s got to be a better way. Otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this blog post.</p>

<h3>The best way: the rel attribute</h3>

<p>When doing research for <a href="http://getsomere.st">my book on REST</a>, I&#8217;ve been doing
a lot of digging into various standards documents. And one of the most important
attributes from a REST perspective is one that nobody ever talks about or uses:
the <code>rel</code> attribute. From <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#attr-hyperlink-rel">the HTML5 spec</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The rel attribute on a and area elements controls what kinds of links the<br/>elements create. The attribue&#8217;s value must be a set of space-separated tokens.<br/>The allowed keywords and their meanings are defined below.</p></blockquote>


<p>Below? That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#linkTypes">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The following table summarizes the link types that are defined by this<br/>specification. This table is non-normative; the actual definitions for the link<br/>types are given in the next few sections.</p><p>alternate: Gives alternate representations of the current document.<br/>author: Gives a link to the current document&#8217;s author.<br/>bookmark: Gives the permalink for the nearest ancestor section.</p></blockquote>


<p>Hey now! Seems like we&#8217;re on to something. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">RFC 5988</a>,
&#8220;Web Linking&#8221;. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4">Section four</a>
talks about Link Relation Types:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics<br/>of a link.  For example, a link with the relation type &#8220;copyright&#8221;<br/>indicates that the resource identified by the target IRI is a<br/>statement of the copyright terms applying to the current context IRI.</p><p>Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target<br/>resource has particular attributes, or exhibits particular<br/>behaviours; for example, a &#8220;service&#8221; link implies that the identified<br/>resource is part of a defined protocol (in this case, a service<br/> description).</p></blockquote>


<p>Bam! Awesome! This is exactly what we want!</p>

<h2>So how do we use rel attributes?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll be going into more depth about these kinds of topics in <a href="http://getsomere.st">my book</a>,
but here&#8217;s the TL;DR:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are a set of official types. Try to use those if they&#8217;re
applicable, but they&#8217;re quite general, so that&#8217;s often not the case.</li>
<li>You can put whatever else you want. Space delineated.</li>
<li>The best way is to use a URI and then make a resource at that URI
that documents the relation&#8217;s semantics.</li>
</ol>


<p>We&#8217;ll go with option two for now, for simplicity.</p>

<h2>Making our link, with semantics.</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s what a link with our newly minted relation looks like:</p>

<figure role=code><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='html'><div class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;/posts/1/edit&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;edit-post&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Edit this post<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Super simple. Just that one little attribute. Now we can write a step to match:</p>

<figure role=code><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class='ruby'><div class='line'><span class="no">When</span><span class="sr"> /^I choose to edit the article$/</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</div><div class='line'>  <span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;//a[@rel=&#39;edit-article&#39;]&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">click</span>
</div><div class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code matches what we&#8217;d do as a person really well. &#8220;Find the link that
edits an article, and click on it.&#8221; We&#8217;ve not only made the title of our step
match our idea of what a person would do, but the code has followed suit.
Awesome. We can move this link anywhere on the page, our test doesn&#8217;t break.
We can change the text of the link, and our test doesn&#8217;t break. So cool.</p>

<h2>Better tests through web standards</h2>

<p>Turns out that diving around in standards has some practical benefits after all,
eh? Think about the relationship between your cukes, your tests, and your API
clients: Cucumber, through Selenium, is an automated agent that interacts with
your web service. API clients are automated agents that interact with your web
service. Hmmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>If you want to know more about this, that&#8217;s what <a href="http://getsomere.st">my book</a>
is for. I&#8217;ll be covering topics like this in depth, and explaining standards in
simple language.</p>

<p>Seriously. Did you sign up for <a href="http://getsomere.st">my book</a> yet? ;)</p>

<h3>An aside for software devs</h3>

<p>You might not care about anarchism, and I can almost guarantee that you don&#8217;t
care about Marx, but please bear with me. I think my point is best made by
putting the web stuff at the end, so please, just read it. ;) It&#8217;ll be good

<h2>Domain Specific Languages and information density</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been noticing an effect lately that&#8217;s certainly not new; it&#8217;s just come up
frequently. When working within a domain that&#8217;s new to them, most people tend
to not respect the density of the information being given to them, and it
causes them to draw incorrect inferences.</p>

<p>For example, this tweet earlier:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Does anybody else&#8217;s head explode when they read an &#8220;unless&#8221; statement? What good is readability if comprehension goes out the window?</p>&mdash; Christopher Deutsch (@cdeutsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147349882246676480" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:18:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>


<p>And this response:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@cdeutsch There are weirder idioms. @users.collect{|u| u.email} vs @users.collect(&:email) :) That should weird you out more.</p>&mdash; Brian P. Hogan (@bphogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147359596602851328" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:54:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>


<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that Christopher is in the wrong here, in fact, he agrees
with what I&#8217;m about to say:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@philcrissman @bphogan I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get used to the &#8220;unless&#8221; pattern someday. But from a Ruby outsiders perspective it&#8217;s hard to comprehend</p>&mdash; Christopher Deutsch (@cdeutsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterapi/status/147358978404401152" data-datetime="2011-12-15T11:54:00-05:00">December 15, 2011</a></blockquote>


<p>From someone new to Ruby, <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> or <code>unless</code> are hard to understand
initially, and that&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve increased the density of information
being conveyed. <code>unless</code> is the same as <code>if not</code> and <code>&amp;:foo</code> is the same as
<code>{|a| a.foo }</code>. Both of these constructs condense something more complicated
into something that is simpler, but denser.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll note that I said &#8216;simpler,&#8217; but by a certain measure, <code>&amp;:foo</code> is actually
more complex. When I say <code>&amp;:foo</code> is simpler, I&#8217;m meaning for someone who&#8217;s well
versed in Ruby, functional programming, or first-class functions. I have this exact
background, and so for me, <code>collection.map &amp;:foo</code> is simpler and more readable
than <code>collection.map {|a| a.foo }</code>. When I read the first example, I say in my head
&#8220;Map foo over the collection.&#8221; You have to grok what map really is to get that sentence
or the corresponding code. Whereas what (I imagine) someone who does not have this
kind of background thinks when they see the second example is &#8220;Okay, so map is
like an each, and for each thing in the collection, we&#8217;re going to call foo on it.&#8221;
This is a totally valid interpretation, but notice how much longer it is, and how much
more involved in the details it is. That&#8217;s cool, but to someone who groks map, it
has a much larger amount of mental overhead, in the same way that my concise explanation
causes much more thinking for someone who doesn&#8217;t grok it.</p>

<p>This happens often in education. DHH made <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3328427">a comment</a>
about this recently that illustrates this principle, and he couches it in terms of
&#8220;learnability&#8221; vs. &#8220;readability&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you optimize a framework for beginners, you&#8217;re optimizing for
learnability. That&#8217;s great for the first few days or even weeks of learning.
But once you&#8217;re past that, it&#8217;s not so great. What you care more about is the
usability of the thing once you know it. There are plenty of cases where
learnability and usability are in conflict. Letting learnability win is a
short-term relief.</p>

<p>If you on the other hand optimize for usability, for making things simple and
easy to use for someone who understands the basics, you&#8217;ll often end up with
something that has great learnability as well. Maybe not as much as could be
achieved as if that was your only goal, but plenty still.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that &#8216;learnability&#8217; is a pretty good shortening for &#8216;light density&#8217; and
&#8216;usability&#8217; is decent for &#8216;heavy density.&#8217; It&#8217;s the same effect, though. For the
rest of this essay, I&#8217;ll be using &#8216;learnable&#8217; and &#8216;usable&#8217; to mean this
particular usage.</p>

<p>Any time you encounter experts in a particular domain, they&#8217;ll often have
fairly specific language that corresponds to that domain. This language is
usually designed to be usable, not learnable. This is because they&#8217;ve already done
the learning; learnability holds no utility for them. However, usability is
incredibly&#8230; useful. To them. They&#8217;re working at a higher level of abstraction,
and don&#8217;t want to get bogged down in details they already know well. Using
learnable language would cause them to take twice as long to say things; to
return to the density analogy, dense information is transferred from one person
to another more quickly. If you can read a sentence a second, but that sentence
is dense, you acquire much more information per second than if it was lighter.</p>

<p>This tendency means that most language that&#8217;s specific to a domain will
generally trend towards the usable at the expense of the learnable. The impact
this has on individuals new to the domain, however, is that of a wall. An
impediment. Overcoming this obstacle requires a bit of good faith on the part
of the beginner; to cross quickly over the chasm between beginner and
expert, they must recognize and respect this aspect of the conversations they
will invariably become a part of. When faced with a term that is used in a
strange way, beginners should ask for clarification, and not start arguments
over semantics they don&#8217;t yet even understand. Experts will recognize these
arguments as coming from a place where concepts are not yet fully understood,
and while they may recognize the need to help educate, if the newbie is being
belligerent, they may just ignore them instead. Nobody wins; the signal/noise
ratio has been decreased, the beginner doesn&#8217;t learn, and everyone&#8217;s time is
wasted.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s three other situations where I&#8217;ve seen this happen lately:</p>

<h2>Marx and the labor theory of value</h2>

<p>Philosophy writing is generally a great example of text that is very much
usable, and not at all learnable. Some writers can still be learnable, but
most are not, in my experience. One of the reasons this happens is that they
introduce concepts early in a text and then utilize them later without
referring back to the earlier definition. This isn&#8217;t a problem for anyone
who&#8217;s thinking about taking off the training wheels or anyone who reads the
entire text. The danger comes in when someone <em>not</em> versed in the entire text
attempts to take portions of it out of its context.</p>

<p>Consider Marx, and <em>Capital</em>. The meaning of &#8216;value&#8217; is a central concern
of his writing, and indeed, entire critique of the political economy. It&#8217;s
so important that the first few chapters are devoted to an (excruciatingly,
frankly) detailed explanation of his thoughts on the true meaning of value.
The rest of <em>Capital</em> is built on top of this: at least in my understanding of
Marx, it all boils back down to that one question. And when having discussions
between people who are devotees of Marx and those who come from other schools
of economics, this kind of language gets in the way.</p>

<p>It also causes ideas to be misrepresented: the first time I was ever introduced
to the labor theory of value, it was by a close friend who&#8217;s very libertarian.
This was a few years ago, so it&#8217;s an obvious paraphrase, but he summarized
it thusly: &#8220;Yeah, I mean, the labor theory of value basically says that people
should be paid for however much work they put into things, so if I take six
hours to make a widget and you take four, the price of a widget from you should
be six yet mine should only be four, and ideas like &#8216;market value&#8217; should be
disregarded. It&#8217;s totally irrelevant if I suck at making widgets, I should get
paid more than you anyway.&#8221; Which, to put it lightly, is a misrepresentation.
While explaining the labor theory of value is outside of the scope of this
post, what I will say is that to Marx, &#8216;value&#8217; is something intrinsic to an
object; it&#8217;s the &#8216;socially necessary abstract labor&#8217; inherent to it. Talk about
dense language! What a capitalist would call &#8216;value,&#8217; a Marxist would call
&#8216;price.&#8217;</p>

<p>As you can see, even just one little word, &#8216;value,&#8217; can be quite dense! Can
you imagine a discussion intended to be &#8216;learnable&#8217; to outsiders about what&#8217;s
meant? Imagine the expansion: &#8216;value&#8217; -> &#8216;socially necessary abstract
labor&#8217; -> &#8230; Marx is already long enough; Capital would be thousands of pages!
Yet to a beginner who flips to Chapter 12, they&#8217;ll read a sentence that contains
&#8216;value&#8217; and draw poor conclusions! They wouldn&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re making a
mistake, I mean, how could five letters be misinterpreted?</p>

<p>Furthermore, people who haven&#8217;t read Marx don&#8217;t generally draw distinctions
between his critique of capitalism and his solution: communism. This is annoying
when trying to explain to people that I love his critique, but am critical
of his answers to its problems; they perceive this weakness in his answer
as a weakness in his description of the problem. Furthermore, they then say
&#8220;but I thought you call yourself a communist?&#8221; and I respond with &#8220;sure; the
issues I have are with the dictatorship of the proletariat, not with the
general idea of communism&#8221; and then their eyes glaze over and they change
the subject. Information density claims another victim&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh, and a great example of Marxist economics in a usable form <a href="http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/303/marxecon.htm">is here</a>.</p>

<h2>Anarchism and &#8216;anarcho&#8217;-capitalists</h2>

<p>Arguments often boil down to these kinds of questions of definition, but one
place where I see it happen almost <em>constantly</em> is amongst anarchists. I mean,
from the outset, anarchists have to battle against the general definition of
&#8216;chaos and disorder&#8217; versus the domain-specific &#8216;without rulers.&#8217; Within that,
&#8216;rulers&#8217; in anarchism is fraught with the same sort of questions that &#8216;value&#8217;
has for Marx. The prime example of this are the terribly misguided
&#8216;anarcho&#8217;-capitalists, better described as &#8216;voluntaryists.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: ancaps lack an understanding of the vast majority of historical
anarchist thought, and so try to appropriate the term &#8216;anarchism&#8217; to describe
their philosophy which is decidedly not anarchist. The ones who do have started
using &#8216;voluntaryist&#8217; to describe themselves, which is a great example of using
information density to mislead, but that&#8217;s a whole separate rant. Here&#8217;s the
411, from <a href="http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionF1">the Anarchist FAQ</a>,
which has its own things to say about density when it comes to the language
specific to political theory discussions:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anarcho&#8221;-capitalists claim to be anarchists because they say that they oppose
government. As noted in the last section, they use a dictionary definition of
anarchism. However, this fails to appreciate that anarchism is a political
theory. As dictionaries are rarely politically sophisticated things, this means
that they fail to recognise that anarchism is more than just opposition to
government, it is also marked a opposition to capitalism (i.e. exploitation and
private property). Thus, opposition to government is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for being an anarchist &#8211; you also need to be opposed to
exploitation and capitalist private property. As &#8220;anarcho&#8221;-capitalists do not
consider interest, rent and profits (i.e. capitalism) to be exploitative nor
oppose capitalist property rights, they are not anarchists.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that Marxists, like many academics, also tend to assert
that anarchists are simply against the state. It is significant that both
Marxists and &#8220;anarcho&#8221;-capitalists tend to define anarchism as purely
opposition to government. This is no co-incidence, as both seek to exclude
anarchism from its place in the wider socialist movement. This makes perfect
sense from the Marxist perspective as it allows them to present their ideology
as the only serious anti-capitalist one around (not to mention associating
anarchism with &#8220;anarcho&#8221;-capitalism is an excellent way of discrediting our
ideas in the wider radical movement). It should go without saying that this is
an obvious and serious misrepresentation of the anarchist position as even a
superficial glance at anarchist theory and history shows that no anarchist
limited their critique of society simply at the state. So while academics and
Marxists seem aware of the anarchist opposition to the state, they usually fail
to grasp the anarchist critique applies to all other authoritarian social
institutions and how it fits into the overall anarchist analysis and struggle.
They seem to think the anarchist condemnation of capitalist private property,
patriarchy and so forth are somehow superfluous additions rather than a logical
position which reflects the core of anarchism.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of the problem with the second half of this quote is that I&#8217;m such an
&#8216;expert&#8217; on this kind of language that I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;ll make sense to
you; without the kind of background reading in socialist political philosophies,
it might just be gibberish. At least, the first paragraph should be pretty
straightforward, and you can take the second as an example of this kind of
language.</p>

<p>Giving you a short explanation of why anarchists are against Capitalism is a
great example in and of itself of domain specific language and density. Here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Property is theft.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a quote by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon">Proudhon</a>,
the first person to call himself an anarchist. Let&#8217;s unpack the first few layers
of this statement:</p>

<p>Property. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property">Wikipedia&#8217;s explanation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Private property is the right of persons and firms to obtain, own, control,
employ, dispose of, and bequeath land, capital, and other forms of property.
Private property is distinguishable from public property, which refers to
assets owned by a state, community or government rather than by individuals or
a business entity. Private property emerged as the dominant form of property
in the means of production and land during the Industrial Revolution in the
early 18th century, displacing feudal property, guilds, cottage industry and
craft production, which were based on ownership of the tools for production by
individual laborers or guilds of craftspeople.</p>

<p>Marxists and socialists distinguish between &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;personal
property&#8221;, defining the former as the means of production in reference to
private enterprise based on socialized production and wage labor; and the
latter as consumer goods or goods produced by an individual.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whew! There&#8217;s a few things to note here: Captialists like to pretend that capitalism
is synonymous with &#8216;trade,&#8217; and not something that started in the 1800s. Likewise,
that private property rights are something that has always existed. However,
as this alludes to, there are many different kinds of property rights that have
existed at different places and times.</p>

<p>So in &#8216;property is theft,&#8217; Proudhon is referring to private ownership of the
&#8216;means of production.&#8217; Let&#8217;s expand that. Again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Means of production refers to physical, non-human inputs used in production—the
factories, machines, and tools used to produce wealth — along with both
infrastructural capital and natural capital. This includes the classical
factors of production minus financial capital and minus human capital. They
include two broad categories of objects: instruments of labour (tools,
factories, infrastructure, etc.) and subjects of labour (natural resources and
raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labour, using the instruments
of labour, to create a product; or, stated another way, labour acting on the
means of production creates a product. When used in the broad sense, the
&#8220;means of production&#8221; includes the &#8220;means of distribution&#8221; which includes
stores, banks, and railroads. The term can be simply and picturesquely
described in an agrarian society as the soil and the shovel; in an industrial
society, the mines and the factories.</p></blockquote>

<p>We could continue to discuss how to distinguish between this &#8216;private property&#8217;
and &#8216;possessions,&#8217; which anarchists are <em>not</em> against, but I&#8217;m just trying to
demonstrate that this word &#8216;property&#8217; is incredibly complex.</p>

<p>Okay, so Proudhon claims that &#8216;owning the physical inputs used in factories used
to produce wealth is theft.&#8217; I could expand on &#8216;theft,&#8217; but really, I think my
point about density is made.  For more on this, see
<a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secB3.html">Why are anarchists against private property?</a>.</p>

<h2>Web standards</h2>

<p>Web standards are another great example of a domain that has a lot of very specific
language. And one that people often think they can grab random chunks out of and
quote without fully understanding the rest of the context.</p>

<p>This is going on right now <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505">with Rails</a>.
There&#8217;s a discussion about if the <code>PATCH</code> HTTP verb should get support, and if it
should be the verb that matches to the <code>update</code> action or not. It&#8217;s ended up
in a discussion about the semantics of <code>PUT</code>, which has resulted in a lot of
random quoting of standards documents by myself and others. Here&#8217;s some running
commentary on some of the comments. It&#8217;s impossible to do this without it becoming
semi-personal, so let me just say upfront that I think everyone is participating
honestly in this discussion, but I think it&#8217;s a great example of people who aren&#8217;t
familiar with a domain jumping in and drawing incorrect conclusions.</p>

<p>First up, benatkin comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>I googled for HTTP verbs and clicked the first result and PATCH isn&#8217;t listed.</p>

<p>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html</p>

<p>Where is it?</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyone participating in a discussion about <code>PATCH</code> should be reasonably familiar
with <code>PATCH</code>. Learning where <code>PATCH</code> is defined is as simple as <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=http+patch">Googling HTTP PATCH</a>,
which shows it being defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">RFC 5879</a>.
With that said, this is a good example of asking for clarification, and not
immediately progressing into an argumentatitive &#8220;It&#8217;s not in HTTP 1.1, so it&#8217;s
bullshit!&#8221; style of learning where <code>PATCH</code> is being defined.</p>

<p>Of course, the thread starts to dissolve later, when @stevegraham mentions:</p>

<blockquote><p>i must be the only person in the world that disagrees with &#8220;PUT requires a
complete replacement&#8221;, as per RFC2616 &#8220;HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT
method affects the state of an origin server&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, Steve is an awesome guy, but he&#8217;s a bit misguided in this case. This is
a great example of drawing an incorrect conclusion based on one sentence out
of context. He&#8217;s not <em>wrong</em> in a strict sense, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>
does contain that line. However, this is because <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05425.html">HTTP defines the semantics of communication</a>,
and the semantics are &#8216;idempotent creation or replacement.&#8217; The fact that
HTTP does not define how PUT affects state is irrelevant, an entire representation
is needed for idempotency reasons. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6">PUT&#8217;s definition</a>
also says pretty clearly:</p>

<blockquote><p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied
Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the
enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing
on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing
resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the
requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The enclosed entity be stored&#8221; is pretty straightforward: it needs an entity,
not a portion of an entity. Furthermore, how is a server going to create a
resource without a complete representation if the resource didn&#8217;t already exist?</p>

<p>In this case, the standard&#8217;s organization also doesn&#8217;t help: if you just read
the section titled <code>PUT</code>, you wouldn&#8217;t get the full understanding, since the fact
that it&#8217;s safe and idempotent is mentioned above in the section regarding those
two things. I&#8217;m not sure why those aspects aren&#8217;t in each definition, and are
in a different section above, but the point is that you need to consider the
full document in its entirety to understand the semantics of <code>PUT</code>. Steve is
only reading one section and then extrapolating from there.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more in that pull request, but one more example: Konstantin points
out that Rails supports a lot of things that aren&#8217;t standards:</p>

<blockquote><p>You mean Rails should not support proposed standards like, say, Cookies?</p></blockquote>

<p>Yep. Did you know that? Cookies aren&#8217;t actually a standard, just a proposed one.</p>

<p>Anyway, I also want to say this: I am not a perfect interpreter of these things
either. I often change my opinions after learning more things, and I think this
is a good thing. There&#8217;s nothing the matter with being wrong; it&#8217;s how you handle
it that matters. The discussion in this thread continues. RFCs are also not
perfect, and do have wiggle-room; but it&#8217;s important that agreements are followed.
Amongst people who discuss REST and HTTP, the fact that PUT requires a full
representation is not controversial; it&#8217;s simply understood as true.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s good for you!</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to turn anyone off from learning new things; exploring new domains
is a great path towards personal growth. I&#8217;ve said a few times that I think
more programmers should read Marx, and it&#8217;s because I think this experience of
jumping into the deep end of a new set of language that you don&#8217;t fully
understand is a tremendous educational experience. But to truly learn, an open
mind and open ears are crucial. Making arguments on semantics doesn&#8217;t work if
you don&#8217;t understand the context and semantics of words, as words change
significantly when placed in different surroundings.</p>

<h2>Incidental coupling: the silent killer</h2>

<p>The biggest problem with CanCan from the Fast Tests perspective is that we&#8217;ve
got coupling with class names. In order to test our Ability class, we also have
to load User and Article. Let&#8217;s try it without concern for how isolated our
tests are:</p>

<p>A few notes about testing with CanCan: I like to organize them with contexts for
the different kinds of users, and then what their abilities are below. It gives
you a really nice way of setting up those <code>let</code> blocks, and our tests read real nicely.</p>

<p>Anyway, so yeah. This loads up all of our models, connects to the DB, etc. This
is unfortunate. It&#8217;d be nice if we didn&#8217;t have to load up <code>User</code> and <code>Article</code>.
Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no real way around it in our <code>Ability</code>, I mean, if you
want them to read all Articles, you have to pass in <code>Article</code>&#8230; hmm. What about
this?</p>

<p>Turns out this works just as well. CanCan reflects on the class that you pass
in, so if we just give our double the right class, it&#8217;s all gravy. Now we&#8217;re not
loading <code>Article</code>, but what about <code>User</code>?</p>

<p>The key is in the <code>||=</code>. If we pass in a <code>User</code>, we won&#8217;t call <code>User.new</code>. So let&#8217;s
stub that:</p>

<p>Sweet! The first one is a random user: all their <code>is?</code> calls should be false.
The second is our user who&#8217;s paid up; we need to stub out their role properly,
but that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s that easy</h2>

<p>With some dillegence, isolating your tests isn&#8217;t hard, and works really well. I
have a few more tests in the example I took this from, and 14 examples still
take about a third of a second. Not too shabby!</p>

<p>Happy authorizing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note about Devise, and its RESTful implications. I ran across this
error today, and thought I&#8217;d share.</p>

<p>I was trying to log out, so I hit the normal route for such things with my browser. Here&#8217;s the error:</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>Devise: ActionController::RoutingError (No Route Matches [GET] /users/sign_out)</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Uhhhhh what? I run rake routes&#8230;</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>$ rake routes | grep destroy_user
</div><div class='line'>    destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out(.:format)      {:action=&gt;"destroy", :controller=&gt;"devise/sessions"}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, wtf? Well, there is that pesky <code>DELETE</code>&#8230; Googling for this error led me to
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/commit/f3385e96abf50e80d2ae282e1fb9bdad87a83d3c">this commit</a>.
Looks like they changed some behavior, you can&#8217;t just go to that page anymore
and log out. Bummer. But why?</p>

<h2>HTTP verbs: transfer semantics, not state</h2>

<p>As I&#8217;ve been doing my research for <a href="http://getsomere.st/">my book on REST</a>, I&#8217;ve
been doing a lot of reading about HTTP. And I kept coming across these kinds of
curious comments in the spec. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin server.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.6: PUT</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Uhhh&#8230; what? Don&#8217;t we all know that PUT means that we should be updating a
resource? And that we have to send the whole representation?</p>

<p>When trying to get to the bottom of this, I came across this:
 comment from Fielding:</p>

<blockquote><p>FWIW, PUT does not mean store.  I must have repeated that a million<br/>times in webdav and related lists.  HTTP defines the intended<br/>semantics of the communication &#8211; the expectations of each party.<br/>The protocol does not define how either side fulfills those expectations,<br/>and it makes damn sure it doesn&#8217;t prevent a server from having<br/>absolute authority over its own resources.  Also, resources are<br/>known to change over time, so if a server accepts an invalid Atom<br/>entry via PUT one second and then immediately thereafter decides<br/>to change it to a valid entry for later GETs, life is grand.</p><footer><strong>Roy Fielding</strong><cite><a href='http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05425.html'>Re: Meaning of PUT, With (Gasp) Evidence</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Soooooooo wtf?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look again at what <code>PUT</code> does:</p>

<blockquote><p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.</p></blockquote>


<p>It says &#8220;store,&#8221; Roy says &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean store.&#8221; Uhhhh&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my &#8216;translated for the laymen&#8217; version of that quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>PUT means &#8216;I&#8217;d like to later GET something at this URI.&#8217; If something is already<br/>there, update it. If there isn&#8217;t anything there, then create it.</p></blockquote>


<p>That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s talking about the semantics of what goes on: create or update.
It doesn&#8217;t actually say anything about how this is implemented. But if you PUT
something to a URI, a GET needs to 200 afterwards. So what&#8217;s the difference between PUT and POST?</p>

<blockquote><p>The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity<br/>enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the<br/>Request-URI in the Request-Line.</p><p>The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server and<br/>is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to<br/>that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing<br/>it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a<br/>record is subordinate to a database.</p><p>The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can<br/>be identified by a URI.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.5: POST</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Again, it&#8217;s really vague about what it <em>does</em>. With POST, it basically says &#8220;You
have no idea what a POST does.&#8221; What you <em>do</em> know is the semantics of the
action, POST &#8216;requests a new subordinate, but it might not create something.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <em>main</em> difference is actually mentioned here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Methods can also have the property of &#8220;idempotence&#8221; in that (aside from error or<br/>expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as<br/>for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.1.2: Idempotent Methods</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Semantics again. PUT is <em>idempotent</em>, and POST is not. They could both be used
for creation, they could both be used for updating. With POST, you don&#8217;t need a
URI, and PUT specifies a specfic one. That&#8217;s it. Nowhere in those two sentences
states &#8216;store in the database,&#8217; nowhere does it says &#8216;full representation,&#8217;
nowhere does it say &#8216;POST is create and PUT is update.&#8217; However you fulfill
these semantics are up to you, but the semantics are what&#8217;s important.</p>

<h2>So wtf does this have to do with Devise?</h2>

<p>The issue is that Devise&#8217;s old semantics were wrong. A GET to <code>/users/sign_out</code> shouldn&#8217;t modify state:</p>

<blockquote><p>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods<br/>SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These<br/>methods ought to be considered &#8220;safe&#8221;.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.1.1: Safe Methods</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>When Devise used GETs to log you out, that was a violation of the semantics of
GET. Here&#8217;s the interesting part, though: Since POST is a super generic &#8216;unsafe
action&#8217; method, you could also use POST to represent a logging out. POST also
has unsafe, non-idempotent semantics. DELETE specifically says delete, and POST
says &#8216;any action,&#8217; and &#8216;delete&#8217; is a subset of &#8216;any action.&#8217; So DELETE is
<em>better</em>, but POST is not <em>wrong</em>, categorically.</p>

<h2>Fixing the &#8216;bug&#8217;</h2>

<p>So how do we take care of this? Personally, I did the pragmatic thing. In
<code>/config/initializers/devise.rb</code></p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>config.sign_out_via = :delete
</div><div class='line'>config.sign_out_via = :get if Rails.env.test?</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, during normal operations, we have our usual DELETE semantics, but in our
test environment, we can just hit it with GET. This way we don&#8217;t have to hit a page, use Javascript to make a link with DELETE, and hit the page. This keeps my test times down, means I can run my tests with rack-test and not Selenium, and still gives me a high level of confidence that my tests work properly, even though it&#8217;s technically not the exact same thing as production.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>The HTTP spec defines <em>semantics</em> but not implementation details. Semantics
should be obeyed. But in testing, obeying them 100% may not be worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Disclaimer: I do have a small credit in this book. A long time ago, the
author mentioned that he was looking for people to help out, so I stepped up.
It was only participating in discussions like &#8220;What do you think about
version control&#8217;s use in industry?&#8221;; I didn&#8217;t help with any actual
writing, and yesterday was my first time reading virtually all the final
content. No monetary interest, of course.</p>

<h3>Lots of new books lately</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of reading over the last few weeks, some of it
technical, some of it non. I&#8217;ve been meaning to type up a few book
reviews, and yesterday I finished reading my copy of Josh Carter&#8217;s
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/jcdeg/new-programmer-s-survival-manual">&#8220;New Programmer&#8217;s Survival Manual,&#8221;</a>
published by PragProg. Since that&#8217;s a bit lighter material than Spinoza, I
figured I&#8217;d write it up first.</p>

<p>The <em>Survival Manual</em> is intended to be the book you should buy after you
graduate from college, but before you get a job. It&#8217;s a bunch of tips,
arranged by topic, that give you a taste of what &#8216;real world&#8217; programming is
like, as well as what working life is about. I think that it accomplishes this
goal wonderfully, but if you&#8217;d like to hear specifics, read on.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>One of my roommates is not particularly technical. She picked the book up, and
read the introduction and the first tip. She then said something that, after
reading all of it, I agree with 100%. &#8220;I like this guy&#8217;s writing style. It&#8217;s
very&#8230; readable.&#8221; Josh&#8217;s prose feels&#8230; comfortable. Like you&#8217;re talking to a
down-to-earth friend, or co-worker. Which is great, given the topic. I
really enjoyed the actual <em>reading</em> of this book. Especially in technical
books, this is a great quality to have, but I guess this book isn&#8217;t
exactly technical; it&#8217;s much more about soft skills than hard.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed the cookbook-style organization. Basically, the book is
one big ball of tips that you can read individually. They&#8217;re grouped together
with three or four others that are on the same topic, but each stands alone, and
they cross-reference each other when appropriate. While I sat down and read it
front to back, I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s pretty easy to cherry-pick certain things and
read it in a more non-linear fashion.</p>

<p>I also feel that &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; is a good description of most of the content. In
particular, as much as we all love DVCS, the book frankly states that most
places still use centralized version control, which is totally true. He makes
sure to carefully not be particularly dogmatic about the specifics of anything,
focusing on strategy more than tactics. For example, &#8220;Get good with your editor,
make sure it can work effectively without using the mouse, for speed,&#8221; not &#8220;zomg
emacs r teh suck, use vim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, Josh links to copious other works, and provides references for all of
it. Some stuff is just general internet culture, but the bibliography alone
would assist any programmer in finding some useful primary materials to read.
Here&#8217;s the first six: <em>SICP</em>, <em>Getting Things Done</em>, <em>Extreme Programming
Explained</em>, <em>TDD By Example</em>, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, and <em>Foundations of
Object Oriented Languages: Types and Semantics</em>. Oh, and just because there&#8217;s
some XP/Agile stuff in those particular books, don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s slanted towards
that: waterfall is explained as well. Just so happens those books were first.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s not that much bad that I can say about this book, really. There are a
few small things, though:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a &#8216;white belt brown belt black belt&#8217; metaphor that&#8217;s supposed to
indicate a difficulty of each tip. Given that there&#8217;s only two black belt tips,
I didn&#8217;t feel that three levels were really needed. I also just thought that
there wasn&#8217;t a huge difference between white and brown, either, so I&#8217;m not sure
that it really adds any utility.</p>

<p>Because this book is fairly high-level, it might be hard to actually <em>apply</em>
these lessons. This might be more of a problem with readers than with the actual
book, but I can&#8217;t count how many times I (and others) have said &#8220;Of course,
write descriptive variable names!!1&#8221; and then typed <code>x = 5</code>. It&#8217;s just the way
things are. And since this book is essentially a collection of advice at that
high level, I can see someone reading this book, and then just simply not
following the advice. I&#8217;m not sure if this is something Josh could have fixed,
or if it&#8217;s inherent in this kind of book. Also, it won&#8217;t affect a diligent
reader. It is something to think about, though.</p>

<h2>Summary: If you just graduated, buy this book</h2>

<p>This book is totally worth it. The style reminds me of the seminal <em>Pragmatic
Programmers</em>. If you&#8217;re a freshly minted graduate, put this book at the top of
your reading list, then also grab a copy of all the books in the bibliography to
read later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a confession to make: Other than one little stint at RubyC, I
haven&#8217;t really written code in almost a month. And I haven&#8217;t really written a
&#8216;real&#8217; blog post in almost six weeks.</p>

<p>It happens. I was hitting it really hard there for a while, and the
combination of stresses from travel, speaking, writing, conference parties, and
everything else was really getting to me. I don&#8217;t think that I was burned out
<em>yet</em>, but I decided to explicitly take the last two weeks off from doing
almost anything to prevent myself from getting to that point.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m going to <em>stop</em> doing any of these things. I&#8217;d be
lying if I tried to say that I&#8217;d be reintroducing long-term balance into my
life. That balance never really existed. I&#8217;ve always been one to throw
myself at things 100%. Balance is something I don&#8217;t do particularly well.</p>

<p>One thing I am going to be working on, though, is this: Hackety and Shoes
stress me out. Like a lot. This causes me to avoid working on them, which
makes them not improve so quickly, which makes me stress about it worse. I&#8217;m
not really sure how to fix that one&#8230; but at some point, I&#8217;m going to have to
confront that.</p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully I&#8217;ll be back at it soon. Those of you waiting on some of my
projects, my bad. Things will still be slow for a bit. I&#8217;m going to D.C. this
weekend to teach kids with Hackety and Lego Mindstorms, so maybe that&#8217;ll get
me out of this funk. Or maybe it&#8217;ll delay it another couple of days.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ll be around again soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, seriously. This is a public service announcment to all MBAs who want to do
startups: &#8216;platform&#8217; does not mean &#8216;web site.&#8217;</p>

<p>I know that &#8216;platform&#8217; is a hot thing right now. But seriously, the term has
become basically useless. It&#8217;s almost to the point that I just pretend you
don&#8217;t even say it.</p>

<p>A platform is primarily a B2B play. It can be B2C too, maybe, but largely, to
have a platform, you need to enable other people to build something.
Usually, that&#8217;s another business. But if your website does not enable
others to build something, or you&#8217;re not white labeling it in some way,
you&#8217;re not a platform.</p>

<p>A platform basically needs an API. APIs are the primary way that two pieces of
software connect to one another. If your web service doesn&#8217;t have an API, it&#8217;s
not a platform. White labeling being an exception.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d make this rant longer, but I really need a good platform that addresses my
market segment. Ideally, it&#8217;ll enable some win-win synergies with other
channel partners and grow the pie for both of us. Until then, I really won&#8217;t find
a good solution for this real pain I feel as a content producer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep. Doin&#8217; it. This morning I swung by the Sprint store and picked up a 4G
hotspot. Gonna transfer my number to Google Voice this evening.</p>

<h2>lolwhut?</h2>

<p>Yep. I&#8217;m terribly addicted to my phone right now. This is fine, but I&#8217;m
always interested in improving myself. I have a few friends who&#8217;ve done
similar things, and really enjoyed it. So I&#8217;m giving it a solid 6 months.
Sometimes, experiments work, and sometimes they don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m doing this
for fun more than anything, and so it might not work out. Google Maps is
damn handy.</p>

<h2>So I can&#8217;t call you?</h2>

<p>Naw, it just means there might be a tad more latency. I&#8217;m on my computer all
the effing time anyway, so I doubt that you&#8217;ll really notice. If someone
calls when I&#8217;m not at my computer, Google will just take a recording and
email me the transcript. No biggie.</p>

<h2>Yeah, well, have fun with that!</h2>

<p>I will. And I&#8217;ll keep you all posted on how it goes. I plan to do a
retrospective monthly.</p>

<p>EDIT: I had to change my number because Google Voice wouldn&#8217;t transfer my old
one. So get a hold of me some other way, and I&#8217;ll give you the new one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You walk into work tomorrow morning, and your boss says this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Boss: Hey, we&#8217;re gonna need to go ahead and have you implement
require_relative in rubinius. We have some new servers coming in, and we&#8217;ll
be running it in production, but we use some 1.9.2 features of MRI that
haven&#8217;t been implemented yet. So if you could just go ahead and get to
implementing that, that would be terrific, OK?</p></blockquote>

<p>Wat do?</p>

<p>(Disregard that your boss would never say this. I kinda wish some of mine
would&#8230;)</p>

<blockquote><p>You: Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Err, sorry.</p>

<blockquote><p>You: No problem, boss. Rubinius is mostly just Ruby, and it has a really
helpful core team. I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be a big deal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Would you say this? Well, you should. I&#8217;m not gonna lie and say that <em>every</em>
feature is super simple to implement, or rbx-2.0 would be out already, but for
a language interpreter, Rubinius is one of the easiest I&#8217;ve ever tried to get
into. I actually did implement require_relative last night, and it took me about
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>This is my story.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, I found where require is defined in rbx:</p>

<p>One more pull request, and I&#8217;ve got a patch in on rbx. I had one a few
months ago, but this one was way cooler.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>Even if I didn&#8217;t have some code to look at, because Rubinius is just Ruby, it
was really easy to dive in and check out the code, because it&#8217;s all Ruby.
Seriously. Rubinius is just Ruby. Just Ruby. Ruby.</p>

<p>So dive in and add some features today! If having an awesome alternate Ruby
implementation isn&#8217;t enough for you, the rbx team will bribe you with
special stickers for committers, and sweet black-on-black tshirts for
people with 10 commits or more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got to see Zach Holman give his talk, <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/holman/p/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github">How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub</a>.
It was awesome. Zach is a great speaker, and the slides don&#8217;t do it justice. I
highly recommend catching it on video or in person sometime.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s something that I found really interesting about GitHub&#8217;s
&#8216;process&#8217;: it&#8217;s basically anarchism, applied to software development.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familliar with anarchism, check out <a href="http://truth-reason-liberty.blogspot.com/p/what-i-believe-in.html">&#8220;What I believe in&#8221;</a>.
It&#8217;s a pretty decent introduction to a complicated topic. Ultimately, anarchism
is fairly simple, but it requires dismantling a <em>lot</em> of beliefs that Americans
in particular hold about society, power, and control. We&#8217;re quite happy in this
country to be slaves to the rich, but that&#8217;s another blog post. ;)</p>

<p>Another excellent post on that blog is <a href="http://truth-reason-liberty.blogspot.com/2010/11/digression-on-what-it-means-to-be.html">&#8220;A Digression On What It Means to Be An Anarchist</a>.
I&#8217;m going to use it as a framework to point out my comparison to GitHub. The
first sentence is stolen from TFA, but the second sentence is my GitHub
comparison.</p>

<h2>What anarchists oppose</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Hierarchy – anarchists oppose domination of one person or group of people by
another as detrimental to human society. GitHub has built a very flat process,
where &#8220;some days the CEO ships more code than I do.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Authority – all forms of authority must bear a heavy burden of proof in order
to demonstrate their legitimacy and necessity. GitHub has hired people that have
built awesome things, and have shown themselves to be a trusted authority in
whatever kind of software that they build. Nobody needs to question if anyone
is in the position to deploy or review some code.</p></li>
<li><p>The state – centralised rule of a set geographical area (country) or people
(nation) by a government of elites is inherently illegitimate. Okay, this has
nothing to do with GitHub all together. All abstractions are leaky here. :)
The same goes for Capitalism and State Socialism too.</p></li>
<li><p>Nationalism and fascism – these are but the worst forms of the state, gaining
the loyalty of the people with strong, often brutal discipline and by developing
an almost religious, fevered love of the state and the rulers in the form of
patriotism. GitHub actively uses multiple programming languages in production,
and while it came out of the Ruby world, they don&#8217;t really run around pitching
&#8220;Ruby is awesome and the only thing you should ever use.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Discrimination – nobody should be excluded or discriminated against based on
nothing more than their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, background, or beliefs. I
don&#8217;t know everyone at GitHub, but it&#8217;s a pretty diverse crew overall. This is
hard for any tech company, but they&#8217;re doing pretty well on the race/sex thing.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>What anarchists stand for</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Liberty – all people should be free to live their life as they see fit,
without rules and laws passed from above that serve no purpose other than
control and domination, as long as they are not infringing the right of anybody
else to the same. See Homan&#8217;s talk. That&#8217;s pretty much how they work.</p></li>
<li><p>Equality – as stated above, nobody should face discrimination because of their
gender, ethnicity, sexuality, background, or beliefs. See above comment about
GitHub&#8217;s varied devs.</p></li>
<li><p>Community – human civilisation evolved, from its primitive roots, through the
priciple of Mutual Aid. GitHub has a lot of elements of mutal aid in their
process, where they mention some people in some pull requests, work together
on features, and generally high five until the code is running in production.</p></li>
<li><p>Solidarity – humanity is divided only between the rulers and the ruled. Other
divisions, those which bring about sexism, racism, heterosexism, and other
bigotries, are promoted by the ruling class in order to divide their subjects
and keep them under control. GitHub holds tons of events, buys everyone lots of
beer, and just generally encourages lots of friendly interactions between
everyone. CodeConf was a great group of diverse people hanging out and having
a good time.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>How anarchy would work</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Self-management – groups, such as workforces or local communities, would be
free to operate and govern themselves free of any higher authority. GitHub has
no deadlines, no prioritization meetings, and 100% &#8220;do what you want&#8221; time.</p></li>
<li><p>Free association – all individuals would be free to live where they wanted and
associate with who they chose. Zach mentioned in his talk that different people
work on different parts of the site, and it&#8217;s really based on what people are
interested in and what they&#8217;ve done in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Voluntary federation – instead of the state, where indivudal communities and
groups of people are bound together by the coercive force of a central
authority, local communities and workers collectives can choose for themselves
which other communities or collectives to associate with. Sort of like the free
association comment, people get together and work on what they want to, and
these groups are organic.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct democracy – unlike in parliamentary democracy, these spokespeople would
be just that, elected not to a position of authority but to voice decisions that
remain in the hands of the people, as in trade union and workers council
structures. Anybody can comment on a pull request, add some commits, put in
their two cents, and be heard.</p></li>
<li><p>Mutual Aid – in participatory communities and workers collectives, Mutual Aid
is a central principle. Easily summed up with the phrase “from each according to
his ability, to each according to his need,” this boils down to voluntary
cooperation, fair distribution of resources, and help and support to those who
need it within a local community. As mentioned before, everybody helps each
other out at GitHub to get things done.</p></li>
<li><p>Free, fair trade – for the sharing of resources between different communities
and individuals who opt out of Mutual Aid, anarchy would see the emergence of a
truly free market. This doesn&#8217;t really fit with software, I think. Same with
&#8216;individual liberty.&#8217;</p></li>
<li><p>Collective defence – this is not to say that anarchist society will contain
“perfect people,” and there will certainly be acts of aggression, oppression,
and violence – albeit on a lesser scale than is commonplace in today’s world.
I&#8217;d liken this to things like &#8220;the site is down.&#8221; Everyone at GitHub cares about
GitHub being up, and so they don&#8217;t need someone who&#8217;s responsible for &#8216;defense,&#8217;
as if shit hits the fan, everyone chips in and takes care of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Justice, not vengeance – courts would be elected for each individual case,
rather than appointed and given unnecessary authority, with the aim to establish
guilt or innocence, negotiate reparations, and organise rehabilitation rather
than to support the oppressive prison systems which only make matters worse by
serving as little more than universities of crime. I&#8217;m not sure this fits well
here.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>All abstractions are leaky</h2>

<p>Just like when &#8216;lean&#8217; was a concept that applied manufacturing techniques to
software development, I don&#8217;t think that &#8216;anarchism&#8217; is a 100% fit with GitHub&#8217;s
process. I do think that it&#8217;s close enough to hold a lot of value, however,
even to the point that Zach had to write a blog post about <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/scaling-github-employees/">scaling</a>,
which is something that <em>always</em> gets leveled at people talking about anarchism.
I see GitHub in the same way that I see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain">anarchist Catalonia</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory">Free Territory</a> in the Ukraine.
It&#8217;s a place where ideals are actually working in practice. Let&#8217;s just hope that
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_Catalonia#Clashes_with_the_Communists">communists don&#8217;t betray them when the fascists show up</a>.</p>

<p>Damn leaky abstractions.</p>
