  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note about Devise, and its RESTful implications. I ran across this
error today, and thought I&#8217;d share.</p>

<p>I was trying to log out, so I hit the normal route for such things with my browser. Here&#8217;s the error:</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>Devise: ActionController::RoutingError (No Route Matches [GET] /users/sign_out)</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Uhhhhh what? I run rake routes&#8230;</p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>$ rake routes | grep destroy_user
</div><div class='line'>    destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out(.:format)      {:action=&gt;"destroy", :controller=&gt;"devise/sessions"}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, wtf? Well, there is that pesky <code>DELETE</code>&#8230; Googling for this error led me to
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/commit/f3385e96abf50e80d2ae282e1fb9bdad87a83d3c">this commit</a>.
Looks like they changed some behavior, you can&#8217;t just go to that page anymore
and log out. Bummer. But why?</p>

<h2>HTTP verbs: transfer semantics, not state</h2>

<p>As I&#8217;ve been doing my research for <a href="http://getsomere.st/">my book on REST</a>, I&#8217;ve
been doing a lot of reading about HTTP. And I kept coming across these kinds of
curious comments in the spec. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin server.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.6: PUT</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Uhhh&#8230; what? Don&#8217;t we all know that PUT means that we should be updating a
resource? And that we have to send the whole representation?</p>

<p>When trying to get to the bottom of this, I came across this:
 comment from Fielding]():</p>

<blockquote><p>FWIW, PUT does not mean store.  I must have repeated that a million<br/>times in webdav and related lists.  HTTP defines the intended<br/>semantics of the communication &#8211; the expectations of each party.<br/>The protocol does not define how either side fulfills those expectations,<br/>and it makes damn sure it doesn&#8217;t prevent a server from having<br/>absolute authority over its own resources.  Also, resources are<br/>known to change over time, so if a server accepts an invalid Atom<br/>entry via PUT one second and then immediately thereafter decides<br/>to change it to a valid entry for later GETs, life is grand.</p><footer><strong>Roy Fielding</strong><cite><a href='http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05425.html'>Re: Meaning of PUT, With (Gasp) Evidence</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Soooooooo wtf?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look again at what <code>PUT</code> does:</p>

<blockquote><p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.</p></blockquote>


<p>It says &#8220;store,&#8221; Roy says &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean store.&#8221; Uhhhh&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my &#8216;translated for the laymen&#8217; version of that quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>PUT means &#8216;I&#8217;d like to later GET something at this URI.&#8217; If something is already<br/>there, update it. If there isn&#8217;t anything there, then create it.</p></blockquote>


<p>That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s talking about the semantics of what goes on: create or update.
It doesn&#8217;t actually say anything about how this is implemented. But if you PUT
something to a URI, a GET needs to 200 afterwards. So what&#8217;s the difference between PUT and POST?</p>

<blockquote><p>The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity<br/>enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the<br/>Request-URI in the Request-Line.</p><p>The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server and<br/>is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to<br/>that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing<br/>it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a<br/>record is subordinate to a database.</p><p>The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can<br/>be identified by a URI.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.5: POST</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Again, it&#8217;s really vague about what it <em>does</em>. With POST, it basically says &#8220;You
have no idea what a POST does.&#8221; What you <em>do</em> know is the semantics of the
action, POST &#8216;requests a new subordinate, but it might not create something.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <em>main</em> difference is actually mentioned here:</p>

<blockquote><p>Methods can also have the property of &#8220;idempotence&#8221; in that (aside from error or<br/>expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as<br/>for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.1.2: Idempotent Methods</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Semantics again. PUT is <em>idempotent</em>, and POST is not. They could both be used
for creation, they could both be used for updating. With POST, you don&#8217;t need a
URI, and PUT specifies a specfic one. That&#8217;s it. Nowhere in those two sentences
states &#8216;store in the database,&#8217; nowhere does it says &#8216;full representation,&#8217;
nowhere does it say &#8216;POST is create and PUT is update.&#8217; However you fulfill
these semantics are up to you, but the semantics are what&#8217;s important.</p>

<h2>So wtf does this have to do with Devise?</h2>

<p>The issue is that Devise&#8217;s old semantics were wrong. A GET to <code>/users/sign_out</code> shouldn&#8217;t modify state:</p>

<blockquote><p>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods<br/>SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These<br/>methods ought to be considered &#8220;safe&#8221;.</p><footer><strong>HTTP sec 9.1.1: Safe Methods</strong><cite><a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1'>www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>When Devise used GETs to log you out, that was a violation of the semantics of
GET. Here&#8217;s the interesting part, though: Since POST is a super generic &#8216;unsafe
action&#8217; method, you could also use POST to represent a logging out. POST also
has unsafe, non-idempotent semantics. DELETE specifically says delete, and POST
says &#8216;any action,&#8217; and &#8216;delete&#8217; is a subset of &#8216;any action.&#8217; So DELETE is
<em>better</em>, but POST is not <em>wrong</em>, categorically.</p>

<h2>Fixing the &#8216;bug&#8217;</h2>

<p>So how do we take care of this? Personally, I did the pragmatic thing. In
<code>/config/initializers/devise.rb</code></p>

<figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>config.sign_out_via = :delete
</div><div class='line'>config.sign_out_via = :get if Rails.env.test?</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, during normal operations, we have our usual DELETE semantics, but in our
test environment, we can just hit it with GET. This way we don&#8217;t have to hit a page, use Javascript to make a link with DELETE, and hit the page. This keeps my test times down, means I can run my tests with rack-test and not Selenium, and still gives me a high level of confidence that my tests work properly, even though it&#8217;s technically not the exact same thing as production.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>The HTTP spec defines <em>semantics</em> but not implementation details. Semantics
should be obeyed. But in testing, obeying them 100% may not be worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Disclaimer: I do have a small credit in this book. A long time ago, the
author mentioned that he was looking for people to help out, so I stepped up.
It was only participating in discussions like &#8220;What do you think about
version control&#8217;s use in industry?&#8221;; I didn&#8217;t help with any actual
writing, and yesterday was my first time reading virtually all the final
content. No monetary interest, of course.</p>

<h3>Lots of new books lately</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of reading over the last few weeks, some of it
technical, some of it non. I&#8217;ve been meaning to type up a few book
reviews, and yesterday I finished reading my copy of Josh Carter&#8217;s
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/jcdeg/new-programmer-s-survival-manual">&#8220;New Programmer&#8217;s Survival Manual,&#8221;</a>
published by PragProg. Since that&#8217;s a bit lighter material than Spinoza, I
figured I&#8217;d write it up first.</p>

<p>The <em>Survival Manual</em> is intended to be the book you should buy after you
graduate from college, but before you get a job. It&#8217;s a bunch of tips,
arranged by topic, that give you a taste of what &#8216;real world&#8217; programming is
like, as well as what working life is about. I think that it accomplishes this
goal wonderfully, but if you&#8217;d like to hear specifics, read on.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>One of my roommates is not particularly technical. She picked the book up, and
read the introduction and the first tip. She then said something that, after
reading all of it, I agree with 100%. &#8220;I like this guy&#8217;s writing style. It&#8217;s
very&#8230; readable.&#8221; Josh&#8217;s prose feels&#8230; comfortable. Like you&#8217;re talking to a
down-to-earth friend, or co-worker. Which is great, given the topic. I
really enjoyed the actual <em>reading</em> of this book. Especially in technical
books, this is a great quality to have, but I guess this book isn&#8217;t
exactly technical; it&#8217;s much more about soft skills than hard.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed the cookbook-style organization. Basically, the book is
one big ball of tips that you can read individually. They&#8217;re grouped together
with three or four others that are on the same topic, but each stands alone, and
they cross-reference each other when appropriate. While I sat down and read it
front to back, I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s pretty easy to cherry-pick certain things and
read it in a more non-linear fashion.</p>

<p>I also feel that &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; is a good description of most of the content. In
particular, as much as we all love DVCS, the book frankly states that most
places still use centralized version control, which is totally true. He makes
sure to carefully not be particularly dogmatic about the specifics of anything,
focusing on strategy more than tactics. For example, &#8220;Get good with your editor,
make sure it can work effectively without using the mouse, for speed,&#8221; not &#8220;zomg
emacs r teh suck, use vim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally, Josh links to copious other works, and provides references for all of
it. Some stuff is just general internet culture, but the bibliography alone
would assist any programmer in finding some useful primary materials to read.
Here&#8217;s the first six: <em>SICP</em>, <em>Getting Things Done</em>, <em>Extreme Programming
Explained</em>, <em>TDD By Example</em>, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, and <em>Foundations of
Object Oriented Languages: Types and Semantics</em>. Oh, and just because there&#8217;s
some XP/Agile stuff in those particular books, don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s slanted towards
that: waterfall is explained as well. Just so happens those books were first.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s not that much bad that I can say about this book, really. There are a
few small things, though:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a &#8216;white belt brown belt black belt&#8217; metaphor that&#8217;s supposed to
indicate a difficulty of each tip. Given that there&#8217;s only two black belt tips,
I didn&#8217;t feel that three levels were really needed. I also just thought that
there wasn&#8217;t a huge difference between white and brown, either, so I&#8217;m not sure
that it really adds any utility.</p>

<p>Because this book is fairly high-level, it might be hard to actually <em>apply</em>
these lessons. This might be more of a problem with readers than with the actual
book, but I can&#8217;t count how many times I (and others) have said &#8220;Of course,
write descriptive variable names!!1&#8221; and then typed <code>x = 5</code>. It&#8217;s just the way
things are. And since this book is essentially a collection of advice at that
high level, I can see someone reading this book, and then just simply not
following the advice. I&#8217;m not sure if this is something Josh could have fixed,
or if it&#8217;s inherent in this kind of book. Also, it won&#8217;t affect a diligent
reader. It is something to think about, though.</p>

<h2>Summary: If you just graduated, buy this book</h2>

<p>This book is totally worth it. The style reminds me of the seminal <em>Pragmatic
Programmers</em>. If you&#8217;re a freshly minted graduate, put this book at the top of
your reading list, then also grab a copy of all the books in the bibliography to
read later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a confession to make: Other than one little stint at RubyC, I
haven&#8217;t really written code in almost a month. And I haven&#8217;t really written a
&#8216;real&#8217; blog post in almost six weeks.</p>

<p>It happens. I was hitting it really hard there for a while, and the
combination of stresses from travel, speaking, writing, conference parties, and
everything else was really getting to me. I don&#8217;t think that I was burned out
<em>yet</em>, but I decided to explicitly take the last two weeks off from doing
almost anything to prevent myself from getting to that point.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m going to <em>stop</em> doing any of these things. I&#8217;d be
lying if I tried to say that I&#8217;d be reintroducing long-term balance into my
life. That balance never really existed. I&#8217;ve always been one to throw
myself at things 100%. Balance is something I don&#8217;t do particularly well.</p>

<p>One thing I am going to be working on, though, is this: Hackety and Shoes
stress me out. Like a lot. This causes me to avoid working on them, which
makes them not improve so quickly, which makes me stress about it worse. I&#8217;m
not really sure how to fix that one&#8230; but at some point, I&#8217;m going to have to
confront that.</p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully I&#8217;ll be back at it soon. Those of you waiting on some of my
projects, my bad. Things will still be slow for a bit. I&#8217;m going to D.C. this
weekend to teach kids with Hackety and Lego Mindstorms, so maybe that&#8217;ll get
me out of this funk. Or maybe it&#8217;ll delay it another couple of days.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ll be around again soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, seriously. This is a public service announcment to all MBAs who want to do
startups: &#8216;platform&#8217; does not mean &#8216;web site.&#8217;</p>

<p>I know that &#8216;platform&#8217; is a hot thing right now. But seriously, the term has
become basically useless. It&#8217;s almost to the point that I just pretend you
don&#8217;t even say it.</p>

<p>A platform is primarily a B2B play. It can be B2C too, maybe, but largely, to
have a platform, you need to enable other people to build something.
Usually, that&#8217;s another business. But if your website does not enable
others to build something, or you&#8217;re not white labeling it in some way,
you&#8217;re not a platform.</p>

<p>A platform basically needs an API. APIs are the primary way that two pieces of
software connect to one another. If your web service doesn&#8217;t have an API, it&#8217;s
not a platform. White labeling being an exception.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d make this rant longer, but I really need a good platform that addresses my
market segment. Ideally, it&#8217;ll enable some win-win synergies with other
channel partners and grow the pie for both of us. Until then, I really won&#8217;t find
a good solution for this real pain I feel as a content producer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep. Doin&#8217; it. This morning I swung by the Sprint store and picked up a 4G
hotspot. Gonna transfer my number to Google Voice this evening.</p>

<h2>lolwhut?</h2>

<p>Yep. I&#8217;m terribly addicted to my phone right now. This is fine, but I&#8217;m
always interested in improving myself. I have a few friends who&#8217;ve done
similar things, and really enjoyed it. So I&#8217;m giving it a solid 6 months.
Sometimes, experiments work, and sometimes they don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m doing this
for fun more than anything, and so it might not work out. Google Maps is
damn handy.</p>

<h2>So I can&#8217;t call you?</h2>

<p>Naw, it just means there might be a tad more latency. I&#8217;m on my computer all
the effing time anyway, so I doubt that you&#8217;ll really notice. If someone
calls when I&#8217;m not at my computer, Google will just take a recording and
email me the transcript. No biggie.</p>

<h2>Yeah, well, have fun with that!</h2>

<p>I will. And I&#8217;ll keep you all posted on how it goes. I plan to do a
retrospective monthly.</p>

<p>EDIT: I had to change my number because Google Voice wouldn&#8217;t transfer my old
one. So get a hold of me some other way, and I&#8217;ll give you the new one.</p>

be running it in production, but we use some 1.9.2 features of MRI that

feature is super simple to implement, or rbx-2.0 would be out already, but for
a language interpreter, Rubinius is one of the easiest I&#8217;ve ever tried to get
into. I actually did implement require_relative last night, and it took me about
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>This is my story.</p>

<p>(note: dramatazation. Actual wording made unneccesarily silly to protect the
innocent. please do try this at home)</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, I found where require is defined in rbx:</p>

<p>One more pull request, and I&#8217;ve got a patch in on rbx. I had one a few
months ago, but this one was way cooler.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>Even if I didn&#8217;t have some code to look at, because Rubinius is just Ruby, it
was really easy to dive in and check out the code, because it&#8217;s all Ruby.
Seriously. Rubinius is just Ruby. Just Ruby. Ruby.</p>

<p>So dive in and add some features today! If having an awesome alternate Ruby
implementation isn&#8217;t enough for you, the rbx team will bribe you with
special stickers for committers, and sweet black-on-black tshirts for
people with 10 commits or more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got to see Zach Holman give his talk, <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/holman/p/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github">How GitHub Uses GitHub to Build GitHub</a>.
It was awesome. Zach is a great speaker, and the slides don&#8217;t do it justice. I
highly recommend catching it on video or in person sometime.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s something that I found really interesting about GitHub&#8217;s
&#8216;process&#8217;: it&#8217;s basically anarchism, applied to software development.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familliar with anarchism, check out <a href="http://truth-reason-liberty.blogspot.com/p/what-i-believe-in.html">&#8220;What I believe in&#8221;</a>.
It&#8217;s a pretty decent introduction to a complicated topic. Ultimately, anarchism
is fairly simple, but it requires dismantling a <em>lot</em> of beliefs that Americans
in particular hold about society, power, and control. We&#8217;re quite happy in this
country to be slaves to the rich, but that&#8217;s another blog post. ;)</p>

<p>Another excellent post on that blog is <a href="http://truth-reason-liberty.blogspot.com/2010/11/digression-on-what-it-means-to-be.html">&#8220;A Digression On What It Means to Be An Anarchist</a>.
I&#8217;m going to use it as a framework to point out my comparison to GitHub. The
first sentence is stolen from TFA, but the second sentence is my GitHub
comparison.</p>

<h2>What anarchists oppose</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Hierarchy – anarchists oppose domination of one person or group of people by
another as detrimental to human society. GitHub has built a very flat process,
where &#8220;some days the CEO ships more code than I do.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Authority – all forms of authority must bear a heavy burden of proof in order
to demonstrate their legitimacy and necessity. GitHub has hired people that have
built awesome things, and have shown themselves to be a trusted authority in
whatever kind of software that they build. Nobody needs to question if anyone
is in the position to deploy or review some code.</p></li>
<li><p>The state – centralised rule of a set geographical area (country) or people
(nation) by a government of elites is inherently illegitimate. Okay, this has
nothing to do with GitHub all together. All abstractions are leaky here. :)
The same goes for Capitalism and State Socialism too.</p></li>
<li><p>Nationalism and fascism – these are but the worst forms of the state, gaining
the loyalty of the people with strong, often brutal discipline and by developing
an almost religious, fevered love of the state and the rulers in the form of
patriotism. GitHub actively uses multiple programming languages in production,
and while it came out of the Ruby world, they don&#8217;t really run around pitching
&#8220;Ruby is awesome and the only thing you should ever use.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Discrimination – nobody should be excluded or discriminated against based on
nothing more than their gender, ethnicity, sexuality, background, or beliefs. I
don&#8217;t know everyone at GitHub, but it&#8217;s a pretty diverse crew overall. This is
hard for any tech company, but they&#8217;re doing pretty well on the race/sex thing.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>What anarchists stand for</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Liberty – all people should be free to live their life as they see fit,
without rules and laws passed from above that serve no purpose other than
control and domination, as long as they are not infringing the right of anybody
else to the same. See Homan&#8217;s talk. That&#8217;s pretty much how they work.</p></li>
<li><p>Equality – as stated above, nobody should face discrimination because of their
gender, ethnicity, sexuality, background, or beliefs. See above comment about
GitHub&#8217;s varied devs.</p></li>
<li><p>Community – human civilisation evolved, from its primitive roots, through the
priciple of Mutual Aid. GitHub has a lot of elements of mutal aid in their
process, where they mention some people in some pull requests, work together
on features, and generally high five until the code is running in production.</p></li>
<li><p>Solidarity – humanity is divided only between the rulers and the ruled. Other
divisions, those which bring about sexism, racism, heterosexism, and other
bigotries, are promoted by the ruling class in order to divide their subjects
and keep them under control. GitHub holds tons of events, buys everyone lots of
beer, and just generally encourages lots of friendly interactions between
everyone. CodeConf was a great group of diverse people hanging out and having
a good time.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>How anarchy would work</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Self-management – groups, such as workforces or local communities, would be
free to operate and govern themselves free of any higher authority. GitHub has
no deadlines, no prioritization meetings, and 100% &#8220;do what you want&#8221; time.</p></li>
<li><p>Free association – all individuals would be free to live where they wanted and
associate with who they chose. Zach mentioned in his talk that different people
work on different parts of the site, and it&#8217;s really based on what people are
interested in and what they&#8217;ve done in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Voluntary federation – instead of the state, where indivudal communities and
groups of people are bound together by the coercive force of a central
authority, local communities and workers collectives can choose for themselves
which other communities or collectives to associate with. Sort of like the free
association comment, people get together and work on what they want to, and
these groups are organic.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct democracy – unlike in parliamentary democracy, these spokespeople would
be just that, elected not to a position of authority but to voice decisions that
remain in the hands of the people, as in trade union and workers council
structures. Anybody can comment on a pull request, add some commits, put in
their two cents, and be heard.</p></li>
<li><p>Mutual Aid – in participatory communities and workers collectives, Mutual Aid
is a central principle. Easily summed up with the phrase “from each according to
his ability, to each according to his need,” this boils down to voluntary
cooperation, fair distribution of resources, and help and support to those who
need it within a local community. As mentioned before, everybody helps each
other out at GitHub to get things done.</p></li>
<li><p>Free, fair trade – for the sharing of resources between different communities
and individuals who opt out of Mutual Aid, anarchy would see the emergence of a
truly free market. This doesn&#8217;t really fit with software, I think. Same with
&#8216;individual liberty.&#8217;</p></li>
<li><p>Collective defence – this is not to say that anarchist society will contain
“perfect people,” and there will certainly be acts of aggression, oppression,
and violence – albeit on a lesser scale than is commonplace in today’s world.
I&#8217;d liken this to things like &#8220;the site is down.&#8221; Everyone at GitHub cares about
GitHub being up, and so they don&#8217;t need someone who&#8217;s responsible for &#8216;defense,&#8217;
as if shit hits the fan, everyone chips in and takes care of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Justice, not vengeance – courts would be elected for each individual case,
rather than appointed and given unnecessary authority, with the aim to establish
guilt or innocence, negotiate reparations, and organise rehabilitation rather
than to support the oppressive prison systems which only make matters worse by
serving as little more than universities of crime. I&#8217;m not sure this fits well
here.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>All abstractions are leaky</h2>

<p>Just like when &#8216;lean&#8217; was a concept that applied manufacturing techniques to
software development, I don&#8217;t think that &#8216;anarchism&#8217; is a 100% fit with GitHub&#8217;s
process. I do think that it&#8217;s close enough to hold a lot of value, however,
even to the point that Zach had to write a blog post about <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/scaling-github-employees/">scaling</a>,
which is something that <em>always</em> gets leveled at people talking about anarchism.
I see GitHub in the same way that I see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain">anarchist Catalonia</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory">Free Territory</a> in the Ukraine.
It&#8217;s a place where ideals are actually working in practice. Let&#8217;s just hope that
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_Catalonia#Clashes_with_the_Communists">communists don&#8217;t betray them when the fascists show up</a>.</p>

<p>Damn leaky abstractions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a blog post the other day titled <a href="http://ascarter.net/2011/09/25/modern-ruby-development.html">Modern Ruby Development</a>.
While it&#8217;s a perfectly fine blog post (other than the digs at rvm&#8230;) it really
should have been titled something more along the lines of &#8220;My default tooling
to build a Rails application.&#8221; I thought of this yesterday, as I was invited
to show up at <a href="http://www.vertigo.com/">Vertigo</a> and show them how we do things
in the Open Source world. Vertigo builds lots of cool things, but they tend to
be very .NET centric, and it was neat for both of us to see how the other half
lives.</p>

<p>Shortly before my &#8216;presentation,&#8217; we decided that I&#8217;d basicaly just build a
little web app in front of them. Live coding to the max! We decided for maximum
awesome, and since I was in town for the Twilio conference, that I&#8217;d make a
Twilio app that they could text and it&#8217;d text you &#8216;hello world: you said #{msg}&#8221;
back. I thought I&#8217;d share that process with you, too. I ended up throwing away
the code, though, because I committed my account credentials into the git repo
to simplify things, so I&#8217;ll just be describing it to you. Check my other posts
for code stuff. ;)</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing: lots of this stuff is about getting &#8216;iteration zero&#8217; out
of the way: it&#8217;s setup work that you have to do to set the tone for everything
else. In its own way, it&#8217;s also a tooling overview, I&#8217;ve just focused on the
tools that help the process rather than the language stuff. I&#8217;ve already written
a more &#8216;dev proccess&#8217; style post over at <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/bdd-with-rspec-and-steak">Timeless</a>,
about BDD.</p>

<h2>rvm &#8211;rvmrc &#8211;create 1.9.2@hello_text</h2>

<p>First up: decide what Ruby you&#8217;re using. I talked breifly about MRI, Rubinius,
and JRuby, and some pros and cons for each. I still tend to use MRI for my
production code at the moment, but soon, rbx will become my default.</p>

<p>I use rvm because it does exactly what I want.</p>

<h2>mvim README.md</h2>

<p>I really enjoy <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">README driven development</a>.
I didn&#8217;t actually demo this due to time constraints, but I generally write at
least a minimal README.md before doing anything else. During Windy City Rails,
Tom shared something that he likes doing: <code>mv README.md SPEC.md</code>. That way,
you can keep your actual README in sync with what the code does right now, but
have the final one that you want to work towards too.</p>

<h2>git push origin</h2>

<p>Now that we have a file, we can push it up to GitHub. A few clicks on the web,
a <code>git add remote</code> and <code>git push -u origin master</code> and we&#8217;re off to the races.</p>

<h2>mvim Gemfile &amp;&amp; bundle</h2>

<p>Next up we talked about Bundler, Gemfiles, and managing gems. I talked about
the ability to run your own private gem server for internal gems, and how
easy it is to build and publish a gem.</p>

<h2>mkdir spec</h2>

<p>I then generally type this. I would be lying to you if I told you that I do TDD
100% of the time. Sometimes, I get lazy. But I try to. And since testing is such
a huge part of Ruby culture, and we have world-class testing tools, this is
where I started.</p>

<p>I wrote specs for a model class called SmsGateway. This class would handle
sending a message to a phone via Twilio. I was able to show off rspec, talk
about DSLs, mocking, and TDD.</p>

<h2>mvim something.rb</h2>

<p>In this case it&#8217;s sms_gateway.rb, but you know what I mean. Write some code,
<code>rspec spec/sms_gateway_spec.rb</code>, repeat. Red, Green, Refactor. Wheee!</p>

<h2>mvim .travis.yml</h2>

<p>I wanted to show Travis off, so in my demo I did this before implementing the
gateway class, but normally I&#8217;d do this after the first spec passes.
Continuous Integration and even Continuous Deployment are awesome. Travis
makes it super easy.</p>

<h2>Sign up for external services</h2>

<p>I went over to Twilio&#8217;s site, registered a new account, and got my credentials.
I used their docs to figure out where to put them, and how to get it all going
inside my gateway class (I just mocked it out before), and talked about how
needing to Google for docs is a weakness of Ruby.</p>

<h2>heroku create &amp;&amp; git push heroku master</h2>

<p>Then I showed them how to get going with Heroku, and how easy it was to start
giving them hundreds of dollars per month when you need to scale. .NET people
are used to paying for everything. ;)</p>

<p>I also showed off one of my latest projects, which is an IRC bot that lets me
deploy rstat.us into production. I have some serious Hubot envy. :D</p>

<h2>&#8230; repeat!</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said it worked the first time, I accidentally made a loop
where the app texted itself. Whoops! But that was cool, and showing off my
debugging process (I&#8217;m a <code>puts/throw params</code> debugger) was fun, as well. After
realizing what I did wrong, we had the app working.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s not quite perfect</h2>

<p>This dev process isn&#8217;t perfect yet. Nothing ever is. I&#8217;m always trying to
improve upon it, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with how quickly I&#8217;m able to turn out
new projects with a reasonable amount of quality. What&#8217;s your workflow? How
does mine suck? <a href="mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com">Email me</a>, I&#8217;d love to hear
about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, <a href="http://adrianshort.co.uk/2011/09/25/its-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-know-it/">it&#8217;s the end of the web as we know it</a>.
I&#8217;d already been thinking about this all weekend, and last night, I decided. I
just can&#8217;t deal with Facebook&#8217;s crazy privacy stuff anymore. I mean, I already
basically <a href="http://rstat.us">forked Twitter</a> over their ToS, and Facebook has been
a lot more evil for a lot longer. Frictionless sharing is pretty much the last
straw.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be using this as an excuse to keep helping out with the federated web.
There&#8217;s a lot of cool stuff in this area, but it needs help. If you&#8217;re a
developer, consider helping out with the <a href="https://github.com/LockerProject/Locker">Locker Project</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/homesteading">the Homesteading Project</a>. The only way
that we can prevent people from becoming digial sharecroppers is by helping them
to &#8216;own their own land.&#8217;</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re Facebook friends, you can always find out how to reach me at
<a href="http://steveklabnik.com">http://steveklabnik.com</a>. Please be careful, and
consider if Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings are really worth it to you. They may be,
and they may not. I&#8217;m under no illusions that the vast majority of people will
give up Facebook, but I figured I&#8217;d warn you anyways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone! I just wanted to share One More Thing with you about this rstat.us
refactoring.</p>

<p>The main thrust of the last article I posted was to show you a technique for
extracting a class, getting it under some kind of test, and then refactoring it
a bit. Refactoring is always an iterative process, and Ryan Bates from the
always awesome <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> asked me why I made the
Salmon class into a module, especially given my recent <a href="/2011/09/06/the-secret-to-rails-oo-design.html">rant</a>
against modules. The answer was, &#8216;because it&#8217;s simpler, and the first thing
I thought of.&#8217; He shared with me an alternate implementation that I like too,
and I wanted to share with you. Check it:</p>

<p>This follows a more OO style, and is a bit more well-factored. Here&#8217;s his
description of what he did:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Switched to a class and gave it a name that is a noun (maybe name<br/>should be different though).<br/>2. Moved common method params into instance variables.<br/>3. This simplified the mention/follow/unfollow methods enough to be on one line.<br/>4. Renamed &#8220;send_to_salmon_endpoint&#8221; to &#8220;deliver&#8221; because it feels<br/>nicer, the &#8220;salmon endpoint&#8221; can be assumed due to the name of the<br/>class. I generally don&#8217;t like to put the class name in the method<br/>name.<br/>5. Extracted commented out into its own method with the same name. I<br/>don&#8217;t know if this is really necessary though (same reason as above).</p><p>The only thing that bothers me now is the constant access of<br/>@user.author and @feed.author. This makes me think it should be<br/>interacting directly with authors. However you still need access to<br/>@user.to_rsa_keypair but maybe that method could be moved elsewhere<br/>more accessible.</p></blockquote>


<p>All of these changes are pretty good. Ryan&#8217;s suggestions for moving forward are
pretty good, as well, but I&#8217;d add one more thing: we&#8217;re starting to collect a
bunch of methods all related to delivering more generic HTTP requests in the
protected section. This also might be worth pulling out, too.  Protected/private
in general is a minor smell that indicates there&#8217;s code being used multiple
times that&#8217;s not part of the main objective of the class.  It might not be worth
it yet, but then again, it might. Speaking of protected methods, you might
wonder why I ended up mocking out my protected method in the last post, as well.
There are no more tests that actually test the method is working properly.  This
is true, and it&#8217;s because I was leading into thinking of something like this.
Mocked tests are almost always unit tests, and two methods are two separate
units, so I had just ended up doing it out of habit. This further shows that
maybe an extraction of another class is worthwhile.</p>
