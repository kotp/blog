  <div class="entry-content"><p>Programmers like to think that software is the purest form of
meritocracy. We like to consider ourselves scientists; what we do is
entirely impersonal. I&#8217;m at Lone Star Ruby right now, and the first two
talks are entirely about software as a science.</p>

<p>But this is a fallacy. There&#8217;s a human element to open source that&#8217;s
often totally forgotten, and it drives people away.</p>

<h2>Software Celebrity and Hero Worship</h2>

<p>We sort of acknowledge this, in a way. There are most certainly software
celebrities, even if their celebrity is localized to the community in
which they operate. I heard someone say this today:</p>

<blockquote><p>If I can go to one Ruby conference and not hear anyone mention Zed
Shaw or _why, I can die happy.</p></blockquote>

<p>If I say &#8220;jnicklas&#8221; you say &#8220;Capybara.&#8221; If I say &#8220;DHH&#8221; you say &#8220;Rails.&#8221;
If I say &#8220;matz&#8221; you say &#8220;Ruby.&#8221; We have our heroes, villains, and foils,
just like anybody else. But we forget that in every celebrity, there is
a real person in there. Actual people, who have real thoughts, feelings,
ideas, emotions, and that spend all of their time working for free just
to make your lives better out of the goodness of their heart. Often
<em>after</em> working at day jobs, often <em>at the expense</em> of a personal life,
often <em>straining relationships</em> with people they care about.</p>

<h2>Competition Means Somebody Loses</h2>

<p>I used to think that Git was great because it made forks trivial. It
changed what we mean by &#8216;fork.&#8217; This is largely a good thing. But &#8216;the
eff word&#8217; used to be a last resort. The nuclear option. You&#8217;re fed up,
can&#8217;t take it anymore, and so this is what they&#8217;ve driven you to do.
Forking was Serious Business.</p>

<p>Now, GitHub has made it so easy to fork a project and distribute it to
tons of people, people just fork things willy-nilly. And, from the
outside, competition is good: in theory, it means that the good ideas
work and the bad ideas don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>(A small aside: forking in git is different than &#8216;forking&#8217; in svn. This
overloading of terminology is unfortunate. The fork button is actually
one of my favorite features of GitHub, because it makes contribution
easier. But as it&#8217;s easier to publish new software, it&#8217;s easier to
&#8216;fork&#8217; in the svn sense. It used to be a pain to start a new project,
and GitHub&#8217;s made that so easy that it happens more often than I think
it should.)</p>

<p>But guess what: competition sucks. Cooperation is much better. One of
the biggest problems with competition is that it means that somebody has
to lose. For every winner, someone is a loser. That person is going to
be hurting. In the case of open source, someone has spent (possibly)
years of their life working on something, and now, all of that is gone.
That shit stings.</p>

<p>Sometimes, forks are necessary. Sometimes, there are approaches that are
fundamentally different. Forking is still an option, even if it&#8217;s a last
resort. I&#8217;m also not saying that feelings should totally trump technical
merit. All I&#8217;m saying is this: consider the blood, sweat, and tears of
others before you act. Just in general.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also not a zero-sum game, either. The pie can be grown. But that
also doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s grown in a way that makes anyone feel good
about it. There&#8217;s a difference between &#8220;We represent two sides of some
coin&#8221; and &#8220;Those fuckers make shitty software.&#8221; Both approaches can grow
the pie. One is far better than the other.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the human cost of rapid competition between software projects? Is
this cost worth it?</p>

<h2>Open Source: All take, no give</h2>

<p>The Pareto Principle: 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
This is absolutely true in OSS, and it might be more imbalanced. A few
people contribute, and lots of people use. Sometimes, this is a good
thing: it&#8217;s actually what draws me to open source. I can help people in
a scalable way. My code is currently being used by tens of thousands of
people. This is awesome. Some documentation that I&#8217;ve written is being
read by millions of people. This is way more awesome.</p>

<p>But I rarely get any help with my projects. It&#8217;s really easy to let that
get to a person.</p>

<p>Do you know how many people have told me that what I do is important? I
got given a Ruby Hero award for my work on Hackety and Shoes. Do you
know how many commits I have in on them? Probably less than 200. Do you
know why? I&#8217;ve spent weeks of my life trying to track down bugs, but some
of them are too hard for me, at my current stage of programming-fu. And
it gets depressing. And everyone that&#8217;s ever offered to help has flaked
on me. And all the recognition for something that was largely done by
someone else gets to me, really deeply. And I get tons of people
screaming about Lion support, and &#8216;this doesn&#8217;t work,&#8217; and all sorts of
things&#8230; and no patches. It&#8217;s why the &#8216;patches accepted&#8217; saying was
coined: this shit grinds on you after a while.</p>

<h2>All of my Heroes are Dying</h2>

<p>Today, this situation with rbenv and rvm made me realize something:
everyone that I truly, deeply respect in open source has either burned
out or left. I&#8217;ve said once before that there are four people that I
truly respect in software: Zed Shaw, _why, Yehuda Katz, and (more
recently) Wayne Seguin (and also Aaron Patterson. Dammit. This list is
getting long). All of these developers are brilliant, work hard, and are
tirelessly supporting their communities. That is, until they were driven
away. This isn&#8217;t totally applicable to Yehuda, but it happened to Zed.
It happened to _why. And I can see it happening, right now, to Aaron
and Wayne. And Yehuda isn&#8217;t really doing Ruby&#8230;</p>

<p>But seeing this happen makes me deeply sad. For them personally, for my
own selfish reasons, and that that&#8217;s the state of our communities.</p>

<h2>Where Does This Leave Us?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any answers. I only have a bunch of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do we drive people away from Open Source?</li>
<li>Can we learn to work together, instead of competing?</li>
<li>How can we better recognize this human element?</li>
</ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t contribute to Open Source: please consider thanking someone
that does open source, in a project that you love. Consider helping out,
in even the smallest of ways.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a follow-up post to my post <a href="/2011/07/03/nobody-understands-rest-or-http.html">here</a>. You probably want to
read that first.</p>

<h2>A few words on standards versus pragmatism</h2>

<p>When I wrote my first post on this topic, I tried to take a stance that
would be somewhat soft, yet forceful. Engineering is the art of making
the proper trade-offs, and there are times when following specifications
is simply not the correct decision. With that said, my motivation for
both of these posts is to eradicate some of the ignorance that some
developers have about certain areas of the HTTP spec and Fielding&#8217;s REST
paper. If you understand the correct way, yet choose to do something
else for an informed reason, that&#8217;s absolutely, 100% okay. There&#8217;s no
use throwing out the baby with the bathwater. But ignorance is never a
good thing, and most developers are ignorant when it comes to the
details of REST.</p>

<p>Secondly, while I think that REST is the best way to develop APIs, there
are other valid architectural patterns, too. Yet calling non-REST APIs
&#8216;RESTful&#8217; continues to confuse developers as to what &#8220;RESTful&#8221; means.
I&#8217;m not sure what exactly we should call &#8220;RESTish&#8221; APIs (hey, there we
go, hmmm&#8230;) but I&#8217;m also not under the illusion that I personally will
be able to make a huge dent in this. Hopefully you, humble reader, will
remember this when dealing with APIs in the future, and I&#8217;ll have made a
tiny dent, though.</p>

<h2>So who <em>does</em> understand REST?</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there are two companies that you&#8217;ve probably heard of
who have APIs that are much more RESTful than many others: <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/">Twilio</a>
and <a href="http://developer.github.com/">GitHub</a>. Let&#8217;s take a look at GitHub first.</p>

<h3>GitHub: logically awesome</h3>

<p>GitHub&#8217;s developer resources are not only beautiful, but thorough. In
addition, they make use of lots more of REST.</p>

<h4>The good</h4>

<p>GitHub uses <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/mimes/">custom MIME</a> types for all of their responses. They&#8217;re
using the vendor extensions that I talked about in my post, too. For
example:</p>

<p>  application/vnd.github-issue.text+json</p>

<p>Super cool.</p>

<p>Their <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication">authentication</a> works in three ways: HTTP Basic, OAuth via an
Authentication Header, or via a parameter. This allows for a maximum
amount of compatibility across user agents, and gives the user some
amount of choice.</p>

<p>Their <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">Pagination</a> uses a header I didn&#8217;t discuss in part I: the Link
header. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Here</a>&#8217;s a link to the
reference. Basically, Link headers enable HATEOAS for media types which
aren&#8217;t hypertext. This is important, especially regarding JSON, since
JSON isn&#8217;t hypermedia. More on this at the end of the post. Anyway, so
pagination on GitHub:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -I "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.0.4
Date: Sun, 07 Aug 2011 16:34:48 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4994
Link: &lt;https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists?page=2&gt;; rel="next", &lt;https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists?page=33333&gt;; rel="last"
Content-Length: 29841
</code></pre>

<p>The Link header there shows you how to get to the next page of results.
You don&#8217;t need to know how to construct the URL, you just have to parse
the header and follow it. This, for example, is a great way to connect a
resource that&#8217;s not text-based, such as a PNG, to other resources.</p>

<h4>The bad</h4>

<p>There&#8217;s really only one place that GitHub doesn&#8217;t knock it out of the
park with their new API, and that&#8217;s HATEOAS. GitHub&#8217;s API isn&#8217;t
discoverable, because there&#8217;s no information at the root:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -I https://api.github.com/
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx/1.0.4
Date: Sun, 07 Aug 2011 16:44:02 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
Status: 302 Found
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
Location: http://developer.github.com
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4993
Content-Length: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Well, at least, this is how they present it. If you ask for JSON:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -I https://api.github.com/ -H "Accept: application/json"
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: nginx/1.0.4
Date: Sun, 07 Aug 2011 16:45:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Status: 204 No Content
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4991
Link: &lt;users/{user}&gt;; rel="user", &lt;repos/{user}/{repo}&gt;; rel="repo", &lt;gists&gt;; rel="gists"
</code></pre>

<p>You do get Links, but you have to construct things yourself. As a user,
you get the same thing. It doesn&#8217;t change the links to point to your
repos, it doesn&#8217;t give you links to anything else that you can do with
the API.</p>

<p>Instead, the root should give you a link to the particular resources
that you can actually view. Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -I https://api.github.com/ -H "Accept: application/json" -u
</code></pre>

<p>&#8220;username:password&#8221;</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: nginx/1.0.4
Date: Sun, 07 Aug 2011 16:45:32 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Status: 204 No Content
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4991
Link: &lt;/gists/public&gt;; rel="public_gists", &lt;/user/repos&gt;; rel="repos", &lt;gists&gt;; rel="gists"
</code></pre>

<p>And a bunch more, for all of the other resources that are available.
This would make the API truly discoverable, and you wouldn&#8217;t be forced
to read their gorgeous documentation. :)</p>

<h3>Twilio</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve always really enjoyed Twilio. Their API is incredibly simple to
use. I once hooked up a little &#8220;Text me when someone orders something
from my site&#8221; script, and it took me about fifteen minutes. Good stuff.</p>

<h4>The good</h4>

<p>Twilio has got the HATEOAS thing down. Check it out, their home page
says that the base URL is &#8220;https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01&#8221;. Without
looking at any of the rest of their docs, (I glanced at a page or two,
but I didn&#8217;t really read them fully yet), I did this:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;TwilioResponse&gt;
  &lt;Version&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;2010-04-01&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;Uri&gt;/2010-04-01&lt;/Uri&gt;
    &lt;SubresourceUris&gt;
      &lt;Accounts&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts&lt;/Accounts&gt;
    &lt;/SubresourceUris&gt;
  &lt;/Version&gt;
&lt;/TwilioResponse&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I introduced some formatting. Hmm, okay, Accounts. Let&#8217;s check this out:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;TwilioResponse&gt;&lt;RestException&gt;&lt;Status&gt;401&lt;/Status&gt;&lt;Message&gt;Authenticate&lt;/Message&gt;&lt;Code&gt;20003&lt;/Code&gt;&lt;MoreInfo&gt;http://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003&lt;/MoreInfo&gt;&lt;/RestException&gt;&lt;/TwilioResponse&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so I have to be authenticated. If I was, I&#8217;d get something like
this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TwilioResponse&gt;
  &lt;Account&gt;
    &lt;Sid&gt;ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d&lt;/Sid&gt;
    &lt;FriendlyName&gt;Do you like my friendly name?&lt;/FriendlyName&gt;
    &lt;Type&gt;Full&lt;/Type&gt;
    &lt;Status&gt;active&lt;/Status&gt;
    &lt;DateCreated&gt;Wed, 04 Aug 2010 21:37:41 +0000&lt;/DateCreated&gt;
    &lt;DateUpdated&gt;Fri, 06 Aug 2010 01:15:02 +0000&lt;/DateUpdated&gt;
    &lt;AuthToken&gt;redacted&lt;/AuthToken&gt;
    &lt;Uri&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d&lt;/Uri&gt;
    &lt;SubresourceUris&gt;
      &lt;AvailablePhoneNumbers&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/AvailablePhoneNumbers&lt;/AvailablePhoneNumbers&gt;
      &lt;Calls&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Calls&lt;/Calls&gt;
      &lt;Conferences&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Conferences&lt;/Conferences&gt;
      &lt;IncomingPhoneNumbers&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/IncomingPhoneNumbers&lt;/IncomingPhoneNumbers&gt;
      &lt;Notifications&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Notifications&lt;/Notifications&gt;
      &lt;OutgoingCallerIds&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/OutgoingCallerIds&lt;/OutgoingCallerIds&gt;
      &lt;Recordings&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Recordings&lt;/Recordings&gt;
      &lt;Sandbox&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Sandbox&lt;/Sandbox&gt;
      &lt;SMSMessages&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/SMS/Messages&lt;/SMSMessages&gt;
      &lt;Transcriptions&gt;/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACba8bc05eacf94afdae398e642c9cc32d/Transcriptions&lt;/Transcriptions&gt;
    &lt;/SubresourceUris&gt;
  &lt;/Account&gt;
&lt;/TwilioResponse&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome. I can see my all of the other resources that I can interact
with. Other than knowing how to authenticate, I can follow the links
from the endpoint, and discover their entire API. Rock. This is the way
things are supposed to be.</p>

<h4>The bad</h4>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts -H "Accept: application/json"
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;TwilioResponse&gt;&lt;RestException&gt;&lt;Status&gt;401&lt;/Status&gt;&lt;Message&gt;Authenticate&lt;/Message&gt;&lt;Code&gt;20003&lt;/Code&gt;&lt;MoreInfo&gt;http://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20003&lt;/MoreInfo&gt;&lt;/RestException&gt;&lt;/TwilioResponse&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Versus this:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts.json
{"status":401,"message":"Authenticate","code":20003,"more_info":"http:\/\/www.twilio.com\/docs\/errors\/20003"}
</code></pre>

<p>:/ Returning JSON when your resource ends with &#8216;.json&#8217; isn&#8217;t bad, but
not respecting the Accept header, even when you return the right MIME
type, is just unfortunate.</p>

<h2>&#8230; and a little Announcement</h2>

<p>It seems that this is a topic that people are really interested in. Part
I of this article was pretty well-received, and I got lots of great
email and feedback from people. It was also made pretty clear by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wayneeseguin/status/97733413611638784">a few</a> people that
they want more content from me on this topic.</p>

<p>So I decided to write a book about it. You can check out the site for
&#8221;<a href="http://getsomere.st">Get Some REST</a>&#8221;, and put in your email address. Then you&#8217;ll get
updated when I start pre-release sales.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s in &#8220;Get Some REST&#8221;? It&#8217;s going to be a full description of how
to build RESTful web applications, from the ground up. Designing your
resources, laying out an API, all the details. I&#8217;m going to try to keep
most of the content language-agnostic, but provide code samples in
Rails 3.1, as well.</p>

<p>I plan on writing a bunch of content, and then releasing the book at
half-price in beta. Early adopters will be able to get their two cents
in, and I&#8217;ll cover things they still have questions on. It&#8217;ll be
available under a liberal license, in PDF, ePub, all that good stuff.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also set up a Twitter account at <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/getsomerestbook">@getsomerestbook</a>. I&#8217;ll be tweeting updates about the book, and also other good content
related to RESTful design. Oh, and if you&#8217;re on
<a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a>, I also have an account that&#8217;ll syndicate
the same content at <a href="http://rstat.us/users/getsomerestbook">@getsomerestbook</a> too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I spoke on a panel at <a href="http://therealtimereport.com/">RTLM NY &#8216;11</a>, I got a little rise out of
the crowd when I said &#8220;Twitter is too important to be owned by Twitter.&#8221;
This is still absolutely true, and yesterday was a great example of
that: the #fuckyouwashington debacle.</p>

<p>As of right this second, when I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23fuckyouwashington">search for #fuckyouwashington on
Twitter</a>, they&#8217;re coming in at two or three a second. It&#8217;s crazy. And
it&#8217;s really interesting to read what people have to say, pro and con,
picking their own issues, all of that stuff. Yet, it&#8217;s been removed from
the trending topics.</p>

<p>Now, maybe this particular trend was simply blocked because of the
profanity. Sure, whatever. I don&#8217;t like that, but some might. And
Twitter certainly allows all kinds of trends to stick around that would
also be &#8216;offensive,&#8217; for example, #babymakingsong, #turnoff, and
 #itsalwaystheuglypeople are currently trending. Don&#8217;t even get me
started on trends like #whatblackgirlslike #whatwhitegirls like and the
other racially charged topics. Sure, fine, it&#8217;s their site, they can do
whatever they want.</p>

<p>That, however, is the root of the issue: they can do whatever they want.
And we&#8217;re all beholden to them. Nothing we can do. Maybe I&#8217;m not
sensitive to four letter words, and I <em>do</em> want to hear about things
like this. Too bad, Twitter says no. Maybe I don&#8217;t want <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/07/08/twitter-adding-promoted-tweets-to-your-stream-this-summer/">promoted tweets
added to my stream</a>. Too bad, Twitter says yes.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m feeling worse and worse about Twitter every day. It
sucks, because I really like Twiter, the website. But Twitter, the
company, really bums me out. They promised all of us nerds long ago that
they wouldn&#8217;t do this kind of thing, and they&#8217;re not keeping that
promise. Which means I&#8217;m not really getting emotionally invested in
Twitter any more. It&#8217;s still valuable enough to me to keep using, but I
can&#8217;t care about it the way I used to.</p>

<p>This is why we&#8217;re still hacking away at <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a>. If you haven&#8217;t
heard about it before, you can <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/03/23/announcing-rstat-us.html">read my release announcement</a>. If
you&#8217;re lazier than that, here&#8217;s the summary: rstat.us is a distributed,
open-source Twitter. You can use our public node at the website, or get
your own copy of the code and run your own, make whatever customizations
you&#8217;d like, and you&#8217;re still on equal footing with everyone else in the
network. We&#8217;re on the cusp of a 1.0 announcement, and I&#8217;d love to have
been able to make that in this post, but we&#8217;re still working out some
last kinks. If you&#8217;ve seen it before, you won&#8217;t find much differences
right now, but we have 100% standards compliance, a complete visual
refresh, and some other fun goodies waiting in the wings, ready to come
out shortly.</p>

<p>Just remember: if you use a service like Twitter that&#8217;s controlled by a
company like Twitter, you have to play by their rules. And sometimes,
they&#8217;ll change the rules, and it&#8217;ll be time to move on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Update: Part II of this post is <a href="/2011/08/07/some-people-understand-rest-and-http.html">here</a>. Check it out, and there&#8217;s an announcement at the end!</p>

<p>The more that I&#8217;ve learned about web development, the more that I&#8217;ve
come to appreciate the thoroughness and thoughtfulness of the authors of
the HTTP RFC and Roy Fielding&#8217;s dissertation. It seems like the answers
to most problems come down to &#8220;There&#8217;s a section of the spec for that.&#8221;
Now, obviously, they&#8217;re not infallible, and I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s
zero room for improvement. But it really disappoints me when people
don&#8217;t understand the way that a given issue is supposed to be solved,
and so they make up a partial solution that solves their given case but
doesn&#8217;t jive well with the way that everything else works. There are
valid criticisms of the specs, but they have to come from an informed
place about what the spec says in the first place.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s talk about a few cases where either REST or HTTP (which is clearly
RESTful in its design) solves a common web development problem.</p>

<h3>I need to design my API</h3>

<p>This one is a bit more general, but the others build off of it, so bear
with me.</p>

<p>The core idea of REST is right there in the name: &#8220;Representational
State Transfer&#8221; It&#8217;s about transferring representations of the state&#8230;
of resources. Okay, so one part isn&#8217;t in the name. But still, let&#8217;s
break this down.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<p>From <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1">Fielding&#8217;s dissertation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. Any information
that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service
(e.g. &#8220;today&#8217;s weather in Los Angeles&#8221;), a collection of other resources, a
non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other words, any concept that
might be the target of an author&#8217;s hypertext reference must fit within the
definition of a resource. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of
entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular
point in time.</p></blockquote>

<p>When we interact with a RESTful system, we&#8217;re interacting with a set of
resources. Clients request resources from the server in a variety of
ways. But the key thing here is that resources are <em>nouns</em>. So a RESTful
API consists of a set of URIs that map entities in your system to
endpoints, and then you use HTTP itself for the verbs. If your URLs have
action words in them, you&#8217;re doing it wrong. Let&#8217;s look at an example of
this, from the early days of Rails. When Rails first started messing
around with REST, the URLs looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>/posts/show/1
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Rails today, you&#8217;ll note that the corresponding URL is
this:</p>

<pre><code>/posts/1
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Well, it&#8217;s because the &#8216;show&#8217; is unnecessary; you&#8217;re performing a
GET request, and that demonstrates that you want to show that resource.
It doesn&#8217;t need to be in the URL.</p>

<h4>A digression about actions</h4>

<p>Sometimes, you need to perform some sort of action, though. Verbs are
useful. So how&#8217;s this fit in? Let&#8217;s consider the example of transferring
money from one Account to another. You might decided to build a URI like
this:</p>

<pre><code>POST /accounts/1/transfer/500.00/to/2
</code></pre>

<p>to transfer $500 from Account 1 to Account 2. But this is wrong! What
you really need to do is consider the nouns. You&#8217;re not transferring
money, you&#8217;re creating a Transaction resource:</p>

<pre><code>POST /transactions HTTP/1.1
Host: &lt;snip, and all other headers&gt;

from=1&amp;to=2&amp;amount=500.00
</code></pre>

<p>Got it? So then, it returns the URI for your new Transaction:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 201 OK
Date: Sun, 3 Jul 2011 23:59:59 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 12345
Location: http://foo.com/transactions/1

{"transaction":{"id":1,"uri":"/transactions/1","type":"transfer"}}
</code></pre>

<p>Whoah, <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas">HATEOS</a>! Also, it
may or may not be a good idea to return this JSON as the body; the
important thing is that we have the Location header which tells us where
our new resource is. If we give a client the ID, they might try to
construct their own URL, and the URI is a little redundant, since we
have one in the Location. Regardless, I&#8217;m leaving that JSON there,
because that&#8217;s the way I typed it first. I&#8217;d love to <a href="mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com">hear your thoughts
on this</a> if you feel strongly one way or
the other.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#8217;ve since decided that yes, including the URI is a bad idea. The
Location header makes much more sense. More on this in Part ii, yet to
come.</p>

<p>Anyway, so now we can GET our Transaction:</p>

<pre><code>GET /transactions/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>

<p>and the response:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 blah blah blah

{"id":1,"type":"transfer","status":"in-progress"}
</code></pre>

<p>So we know it&#8217;s working. We can continue to poll the URI and see when
our transaction is finished, or if it failed, or whatever. Easy! But
it&#8217;s about manipulating those nouns.</p>

<h4>Representations</h4>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice a pair of headers in the above HTTP requests and
responses: Accept and Content-Type. These describe the different
&#8216;representation&#8217; of any given resource. From <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_2">Fielding</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation to
capture the current or intended state of that resource and transferring that
representation between components. A representation is a sequence of bytes,
plus representation metadata to describe those bytes. Other commonly used but
less precise names for a representation include: document, file, and HTTP
message entity, instance, or variant.</p>

<p>A representation consists of data, metadata describing the data, and, on
occasion, metadata to describe the metadata (usually for the purpose of
verifying message integrity).</p></blockquote>

<p>So <code>/accounts/1</code> represents a resource. But it doesn&#8217;t include the form
that the resource takes. That&#8217;s what these two headers are for.</p>

<p>This is also why adding <code>.html</code> to the end of your URLs is kinda silly.
If I request <code>/accounts/1.html</code> with an <code>Accept</code> header of
<code>application/json</code>, then I&#8217;ll get JSON. The <code>Content-Type</code> header is the
server telling us what kind of representation it&#8217;s sending back as well.
The important thing, though, is that a given resource can have many
different representations. Ideally, there should be one unambiguous
source of information in a system, and you can get different
representations using <code>Accept</code>.</p>

<h4>State and Transfer</h4>

<p>This is more about the way HTTP is designed, so I&#8217;ll just keep this
short: Requests are designed to be stateless, and the server holds all
of the state for its resources. This is important for caching and a few
other things, but it&#8217;s sort of out of the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Okay. With all of that out of the way, let&#8217;s talk about some more
specific problems that REST/HTTP solve.</p>

<h3>I want my API to be versioned</h3>

<p>The first thing that people do when they want a versioned API is to
shove a /v1/ in the URL. <em><em>THIS IS BAD!!!!!1</em></em>. <code>Accept</code> solves this
problem. What you&#8217;re really asking for is &#8220;I&#8217;d like the version two
representation of this resource.&#8221; So use accept!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>GET /accounts/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.steveklabnik-v2+json
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice a few things: we have a + in our MIME type, and before it
is a bunch of junk that wasn&#8217;t there before. It breaks down into three
things: <code>vnd</code>, my name, and <code>v2</code>. You can guess what v2 means, but what
about <code>vnd</code>. It&#8217;s a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288#section-3.2">Vendor MIME Type</a>.
After all, we don&#8217;t really want just any old JSON, we want my specific
form of JSON. This lets us still have our one URL to represent our
resource, yet version everything appropriately.</p>

<p>I got a comment from <a href="http://avdi.org/">Avdi Grimm</a> about this, too:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s an article you might find interesting: <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1566460">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1566460</a></p>

<p>The author points out that MIMETypes can have parameters, which means you can actually have a mimetype that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>vnd.example-com.foo+json; version=1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, Rails does not (yet) understand this format.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I&#8217;d like my content to be displayed in multiple languages</h3>

<p>This is related, but a little different. What about pages in different
languages? Again, we have a question of representation, not one of
content. /en/whatever is not appropriate here. Turns out, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.4">there&#8217;s a
header for that: Accept-Language</a>.
Respect the headers, and everything works out.</p>

<p>Oh, and I should say this, too: this doesn&#8217;t solve the problem of &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to read this article in Spanish, even though I usually browse in
English.&#8221; Giving your users the option to view your content in different
ways is a good thing. Personally, I&#8217;d consider this to fall out in two
ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s temporary. Stick this option in the session, and if they have the
option set, it trumps the header. You&#8217;re still respecting their usual
preferences, but allowing them to override it.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s more permanent. Make it some aspect of their account, and it
trumps a specific header. Same deal.</li>
</ul>


<h3>I&#8217;d like my content to have a mobile view</h3>

<p>Sounds like I&#8217;m beating a dead horse, but again: it&#8217;s a representation
question. In this case, you&#8217;d like to vary the response by the
User-Agent: give one that&#8217;s mobile-friendly. There&#8217;s a whole list of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">mobile best practices</a> that the w3c
recommends, but the short of it is this: the User-Agent should let you
know that you&#8217;re dealing with a mobile device. For example, here&#8217;s the
first iPhone UA:</p>

<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3
</code></pre>

<p>Then, once detecting you have a mobile User-Agent, you&#8217;d give back a
mobile version of the site. Hosting it on a subdomain is a minor sin,
but really, like I said above, this is really a question of
representation, and so having two URLs that point to the same resource
is kinda awkward.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, for the love of users, please don&#8217;t detect these
headers, then redirect your users to m.whatever.com, at the root. One of my
local news websites does this, and it means that every time I try to follow a
link from Twitter in my mobile browser, I don&#8217;t see their article, I see
their homepage. It&#8217;s infuriating.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;d like to hide some of my content</h3>

<p>Every once in a while, you see a story like this: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/10/25/local-newspaper-boas.html">Local paper boasts
ultimate passive-agressive paywall policy</a>.
Now, I find paywalls distasteful, but this is not the way to do it.
There are technological means to limit content on the web: making users
be logged-in to read things, for example.</p>

<p>When this was discussed on Hacker News, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1834075">here&#8217;s</a>
what I had to say:</p>

<p>nkurz:</p>

<blockquote><p>I presume if I had an unattended roadside vegetable stand with a cash-box, that I&#8217;d be able to prosecute someone who took vegetables without paying, certainly if they also made off with the cash-box. Why is this different on the web? And if a written prohibition has no legal standing, why do so many companies pay lawyers to write click-through &#8220;terms of service&#8221; agreements?</p></blockquote>

<p>me:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Why is this different on the web?</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s go through what happens when I visit a web site. I type a URL in my bar, and hit enter. My web browser makes a request via http to a server, and the server inspects the request, determines if I should see the content or not, and returns either a 200 if I am allowed, and a 403 if I&#8217;m not. So, by viewing their pages, I&#8217;m literally asking permission, and being allowed.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like a misconfiguration of their server; it&#8217;s not doing what they want it to.</p></blockquote>

<h3>I&#8217;d like to do some crazy ajax, yet have permalinks</h3>

<p>This is an example of where the spec is obviously deficient, and so
something had to be done.</p>

<p>As the web grew, AJAXy &#8216;web applications&#8217; started to become more and
more the norm. And so applications wanted to provide deep-linking
capabilities to users, but there&#8217;s a problem: they couldn&#8217;t manipulate
the URL with Javascript without causing a redirect. They <em>could</em>
manipulate the anchor, though. You know, that part after the #. So,
Google came up with a convention: <a href="http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html">Ajax Fragments</a>.
This fixed the problem in the short term, but then the spec got fixed in
the long term: <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/history.html">pushState</a>.
This lets you still provide a nice deep URL to your users, but not have
that awkward #!.</p>

<p>In this case, there was a legitimate technical issue with the spec, and
so it&#8217;s valid to invent something. But then the standard improved, and
so people should stop using #! as HTML5 gains browser support.</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>Seriously, most of the problems that you&#8217;re solving are social, not
technical. The web is decades old at this point, most people have
considered these kinds of problems in the past. That doesn&#8217;t mean that
they always have the right answer, but they usually do have an answer,
and it&#8217;d behoove you to know what it is before you invent something on
your own.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone. Here&#8217;s a draft of an essay I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;d love
to hear your feedback.</p>

<p>The word &#8216;engineering&#8217; has a deep connection to the word &#8216;trade-offs&#8217; in
my mind. Most engineering decisions come down to evaluating a few
differing alternatives, and often multiple factors end up being
negatively correlated. You can make something stronger, but then it will
be heavier. It can be made faster, but then it&#8217;s significantly more
expensive. A good engineer is able to take all of these factors into
account, and design a system such that it maximizes its effectiveness
across the sum of all of the relevant constraints. No matter if you consider
the act of writing software an art, science, or engineering, its indisputable
that designing complex software systems is identical in this respect. There are
dozens of different metrics that system architects take into consideration while
crafting a plan of attack, but but there&#8217;s a deeper question of balance
here that&#8217;s significantly different than these more traditional
engineering issues.</p>

<p>Text, in the form of source code, presents unique challenges of
composition. These difficulties all stem from the same root: source code is a
singular text, but must be intelligible to multiple, simultaneous
audiences. More traditional forms of authorship still take audience into
consideration, of course, but the decision to engage a diverse group of
people is the choice of the writer. While mass appeal may be
something that certain authors strive to attain, it&#8217;s not an inherent
property of their chosen form of expression. Source code, while text,
inhabits a multiplicity of forms, and software developers are confronted
with this inherent multi-faceted complexity when composing any
particular software work. Some of these forms suit certain audiences
better than others, and so it falls to the programmer to manage which
form they are currently working in, consider which audience they are
attempting to write for, and arrange all of these forms amongst one
another in such a way that any particular audience is able to navigate
and extract the proper information from the source without confusion.</p>

<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll expand on the concept of audiences for code, and in a
future post, I&#8217;ll explore the simultaneous forms that code takes.</p>

<h2>The multitude of audiences</h2>

<h3>The default audience: the computer</h3>

<blockquote><p>Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art
is everything else we do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don Knuth</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This may seem obvious, but the when considering the question of &#8220;Who are
programs written for?&#8221;, many would say &#8220;The computer. Duh.&#8221; In many
ways, a computer is the primary reader of a particular piece of source
code. The code that&#8217;s given to a computer will be executed billions of
times per second, repeated, recalculated, and re-interpreted over and
over and over again.</p>

<p>The computer&#8217;s native understanding of software comes from machine
code. Machine code are the binary numbers that the CPU loads into memory
and processes directly. For example, here&#8217;s a line of machine code for
an x86 machine that puts the value &#8216;97&#8217; into the AL register, graciously
stolen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembly_language">from
Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<pre><code>10110000 01100001
</code></pre>

<p>While most would consider this unintelligible, computers were actually
programmed this way at one time. My uncle actually did this by flipping
switches to set the binary and pushed a button to store it in memory.
Unfortunately, what&#8217;s good for the computer isn&#8217;t good for the human
programmer. This is why assembly language was created. Assembly language
has a 1 to 1 mapping to machine code, but is much easier for humans to
understand. Here&#8217;s that same line in assembly:</p>

<pre><code>MOV AL, 61h       ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>MOV</code> corresponds with <code>10110</code>, <code>AL</code> maps to <code>000</code>, and 61 hex is
<code>01100001</code>. <code>MOV</code> is short for &#8216;move,&#8217; though, and this mnemonic is just
a bit easier to understand than <code>10110</code>. This is the most basic example
of a compositional trade-off. It&#8217;s not a true trade-off, because they
map perfectly to one another, but it illustrates the difference between
composing in a language that the computer understands and one that&#8217;s
more natural for the programmer. Another important concept comes into
play, that of <em>compilation</em>. Virtually every work of composition created
in software is automatically translated to another form before it is
executed. We&#8217;ll address this concept more fully when we discuss form
later.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s where assembly stopped, it would remain a 1 to 1 mapping.
However, virtually every assembly language also offers macros, and this
moves the code further away from the machine and destroys the
synchrony of the two forms. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, [EBX]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>[]</code> characters change the meaning of <code>EBX</code>, rather than be the
value stored in that particular register, they imply that the value is a
memory address, and we want to move the contents of that address to
<code>EAX</code>. The generated machine code could now be processed into multiple
valid assembly forms, and so the transformation is only perfect in one
direction, even if it&#8217;s possible to &#8216;decompile&#8217; it into one of those
possible encodings. This is considered to be an acceptable trade-off for
human readability; we very rarely want to turn machine code back into
assembly.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a jump between higher level languages, as well. Here&#8217;s the
assembly statements that adds 2 and 3 together:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, 2
ADD EAX, 3
</code></pre>

<p><code>ADD</code>, of course, is the statement that adds a number to the register
that&#8217;s given. Now <code>EAX</code> has the value 5. Here&#8217;s the same code, but in C:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 2;
x = x + 3;
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple. You can see how the C is much easier to understand; we
say what type <code>x</code> is (an integer), and it&#8217;s a bit more explicit. <code>x</code> is
equal to <code>x</code> + three. However, since the C is divorced from the machine,
and is written for the person, we can change our compiler to make
assembly code that works on a different kind of processor architecture.
If we were to compile the above C for x86_64, a 64 bit version of x86,
we might get some assembly that&#8217;d look like this:</p>

<pre><code>MOVL RAX, 2
ADDL RAX, 3
</code></pre>

<p>While this code looks similar to the above, it is quite different. This
uses the native 64 bit types, rather than the 32 bit types above. The
other important thing is that by writing code that&#8217;s divorced from the
machine, and written for people, we&#8217;re able to translate it into the
code for multiple machines. If we had written the assembly above, when
moving to another architecture, it would have required a total re-write.
And while this particular sample looks very similar, a more complex
piece of code will be significantly divergent, but I don&#8217;t want to go
into the details of two kinds of assembly code. Because we can define
the languages for humans, and the language of computers is somewhat
beholden to the physical machine itself, it&#8217;s significantly easier to do
the translation from C to the two kinds of machines, rather than trying
to translate from one machine to another. What we lose in this kind of
translation, though, is efficiency. Code that was hand-crafted for each
machine would be more performant, and better represent each individual
platform.</p>

<p>Even though we may choose to use a language that&#8217;s more understandable
to people, it still has to be understood by the computer in some form.
This translation will introduce some amount of penalty, and so it&#8217;s
important that this gets taken into consideration. Sometimes, code must
be written in a way that&#8217;s not easy for a person to read, because it&#8217;s
easier for the computer to be efficient with a more opaque
implementation.</p>

<h3>The reflexive audience: the programmer himself</h3>

<blockquote><p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brian Kernighan</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone who writes code has experienced this at some time or another.
You write a whole bunch of code, and then a few months goes by, and you
take a look at it, and it&#8217;s absolutely unintelligible. This happens
because at the time of inception, the author of a particular piece of
code has an incredibly close relationship to it. As it was just written,
the code is obvious to the author. They&#8217;re in the proper mindset to
understand the intention that was drawn upon to necessitate bringing
those lines into the world, and so no extra explanation is necessary. As
time goes on, however, the author becomes more close to the third
audience, other programmers. It&#8217;s important for coders to recognize this
fact, and take preventative steps to ameliorate this confusion.</p>

<p>Even though the author will approach the position of the other audience
eventually, this audience is distinct because there is a certain level
of explanation that sits between undocumented, inexpressive code and
code that&#8217;s well explained, and this is the position most code is in. An
explanation that&#8217;s helpful to those who understand the code, but not to
those who don&#8217;t is better than nothing. This sort of code may be overly
contextual, and could use some added information to improve its clarity.</p>

<h3>The other audience: colleagues and coworkers</h3>

<blockquote><p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code is a violent
psychopath who knows where you live.</p>

<ul>
<li>Martin Golding</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As I touched on earlier, there&#8217;s a similarity between the &#8216;other&#8217;
audience and the reflexive. The primary distinction is drawn around the
proximity to the source. The other does not have the advantage of having
authored the code, and therefore doesn&#8217;t have the native&#8217;s understanding
of the underlying logical organization of the source. This disadvantage
can be overcome via composing in such a manner that the meaning is
emergent from the design. Even if it&#8217;s too complex to be obvious, good
documentation can address this particular deficiency.</p>

<p>Ultimately, much of software design is about modeling. Software that
solves a particular problem should emulate the nature of the challenge
it&#8217;s attempting to address. If this can be achieved, it&#8217;s significantly
easier for those who understand the problem to figure out how the
software works. Therefore, good design can help improve the
effectiveness of a given piece of source to communicate its intent.
Along a similar vector, if the design is similar to code that solves a
particular issue, it&#8217;s easier to understand. As an example, a friend
recently asked for feedback about an interface that he&#8217;d designed. It
loaded a save game file for StarCraft 2. This is what he came up with:</p>

<pre><code>replay_file = File.new("spec/fixtures/1v1-game1.sc2replay")
@replay = SC2Refinery::Parser.parse(replay_file)
</code></pre>

<p>However, Ruby already has several kinds of code in its standard library
that loads some information from disk and parses it into some kind of
data structure that you can use in your program. The JSON, YAML, and
Marshall classes already use a set of methods to import and export data,
and they&#8217;re named <code>load</code> and <code>dump</code>, and they&#8217;re part of the class
directly. Also, in this case, the user of the code shouldn&#8217;t need to
deal with the creation of a file, since it&#8217;s unreasonable to assume that
a game replay would come from any other source. Therefore, after some
discussion, he adopted the following interface instead:</p>

<pre><code>@replay = SC2Refinery.load("spec/fixtures/1v1-game1.sc2replay")
</code></pre>

<p>This is much nicer to use, and is much simpler. While it may not seem
like a whole lot, when rules like this are applied across an entire
codebase, they can significantly increase understanding. Multiple
reductions of mental overhead add up quickly.</p>

<p>My new favorite trick for adding a little bit of modeling that
significantly reduces overhead for the user is the Presenter Pattern.
Jeff Casimir demonstrated this very clearly in his presentation at
RailsConf 2011, &#8221;<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69001/Fat%20Models%20Aren%27t%20Enough%20-%20RailsConf.pdf">Fat Models Aren&#8217;t
Enough</a>&#8221;.
Here&#8217;s a slightly modified example. Imagine that we have a system that
manages students, and we&#8217;d like to display a report card for them. We
might start with some code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>student = Student.find(options[:student_id])
term = Term.find(options[:term_id])
report_type = ReportType.find(options[:report_type])

puts "#{student.last_name}, #{student.first_name}"
puts "#{report_type.report_title} for #{term.start_date} to #{term.end_date}"
student.courses.each do |course|
  course_report = student.report_data_for_course(course)
  puts course_report.to_s
end
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, until this past week, this is the exact code that I would have
written. But it turns out that we can do better. Basically, we&#8217;re
displaying some information that comes from a combination of three
different objects. If we think about it some more, we&#8217;re really trying
to display a report card. So let&#8217;s make an object that represents the
card, and delegates to its sub-objects. It will then know how to display
itself.</p>

<pre><code>class ReportCard
  delegate :start_date, :end_date, :to =&gt; :term
  delegate :first_name, :last_name, :courses, :report_data_for_course, :to =&gt; :student
  delegate :report_title, :to =&gt; :report_type

  def initialize(params)
    @student = Student.find params[:student_id]
    @term = Term.find params[:term_id]
    @report_type = ReportType.find params[:report_type_id]
  end

  def student_name
    [last_name, first_name].join(", ")
  end

  def title
    "#{report_title} for #{start_date} to #{end_date}"
  end

  def course_reports
    out = ""
    courses.each do |course|
      out += report_data_for_course(course)
    end
    out
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is a lot of code. However, as you can see, it&#8217;s all focused on
composing the information and exposing an interface that makes sense for
a report card. Using it is super easy:</p>

<pre><code>report = ReportCard.new(options)
puts report.student_name
puts report.title
puts report.course_reports
</code></pre>

<p>Bam! It&#8217;s incredibly obvious. This code is much more clear than before.
We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;m still as hot on this pattern as I am now in a few
months, but I feel the extra object adds a significant amount of
clarity.</p>

<p>If the model is too hard to create, or if additional clarity is needed,
documentation in the form of comments can also help to improve the
understanding of the &#8216;other&#8217; audience. Comments can be a difficult form
of prose to write, because they need to be written at the correct level
of abstraction. If they simply repeat what the code does, they&#8217;re
useless, and if they&#8217;re too high-level, certain details and semantics
may not be made clear.</p>

<p>Individual bits of code can also be made more clear by developing a
narrative within any particular method that&#8217;s being written. Telling a
story with code may not be something you&#8217;ve considered before, but it&#8217;s
really about maintaining a proper flow in the actions your code is
taking. For example, if there&#8217;s a bunch of error handling strewn about
inside of a method, it&#8217;s less clear than bunching all of the error
handling near the end. Most code should be an act in three parts: input,
processing, and output. If these three parts are mixed together, it can
appear much more complicated.</p>

<h3>The forgotten audience: end-users</h3>

<blockquote><p>If I asked my customers what they wanted, they&#8217;d have told me, &#8220;A
faster horse.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Henry Ford</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, all software is used by someone. Use-value is the driving
force of virtually all code. Code that doesn&#8217;t do anything may be making
some kind of important philosophical statement, but isn&#8217;t really the
sort that I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>The introduction of a user imposes significant restrictions upon the way
that code is composed. End-users do not need to understand the code
itself, but they do need to be able to understand its external
interfaces. These needs place an imposition on the way that the code
needs to be written, because it <em>must</em> address this issue of interface.
Sometimes, interface requirements can create a burden on the internal
implementation. Needing to support certain behaviors and forms can
create complexity for an implementor.</p>

<p>Documentation created for end users must be completely different than
that which is created for those inspecting the code itself. Most
end-users will not be literate in the arts of software development, and
so approach the software object in an entirely different way than those
who write code do. Yet, the same semantics must be passed on to them,
but at a higher level. There&#8217;s a strong movement within the community to
start designing software with this kind of end-user documentation in
mind, called <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">README driven development</a>.
There are advantages to thinking on this level when beginning, but a
nice effect of doing it first is that you can ensure it gets done. A
surprising amount of software has poor documentation for its users,
because it&#8217;s created after the software is finished, and at that time
there&#8217;s intense pressure to ship it out the door. Writing down
information for the end user first ensures that it&#8217;s done properly, that
all development works in accordance with the documentation, and that all
of the use-cases for an end-user have been thought of and are being
addressed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well well well, some things never change. Long ago, I hosted my own
blog, and here we are again. I&#8217;ve moved everything over to Jekyll, if
that means anything to you. You can now <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/blog">look at my blog on
GitHub</a>. Big thanks to <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/2009/12/29/jekyll-on-heroku.html">this
article</a> for
lots of help and pointers with final deployment stuff, and <a href="http://mikeferrier.ca/2011/04/29/blogging-with-jekyll-haml-sass-and-jammit/">this one</a> for haml and sass and stuff. Yay!</p>

<h2>New-ish beginnings</h2>

<p>So why&#8217;d I do this? Well, this is just part of moving more towards
hosting all of my own services, and not relying on services that others
provide. This isn&#8217;t some sort of argument over individualism vs.
collectivism, it&#8217;s more about <a href="http://nomoresharecropping.org/">No More Sharecropping</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still relying on people for hosting, of course. Nobody is 100%
removed, but with my own backup of everything, I&#8217;m in total control
here. It&#8217;s really minimal work to keep this going, and only a few hours
of setup to move everything over.</p>

<h2>A small change in focus, too</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to stop bitching about politics so often, and try to be
more constructive in general. I have a lot to say about this new
humanities angle that my life has taken as of late. Hence, I&#8217;ve changed
the title of my blog. And you can expect more posts along those lines.
More about books, more about art and code, less whining. One may think
I&#8217;m maturing or something&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Update!</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m now making it even easier than this: <a href="/2011/08/22/im-making-it-dead-simple-to-contribute-to-ruby-s-documentation.html">Read my new post about how
I&#8217;ll do this for you</a>. That said, if you want to do it yourself, the following will tell you how.</p>

<h3>Original Article</h3>

<p>Ruby 1.9.3 is coming out soon! <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/2011/05/09/ruby-1-9-3-documentation-challenge">drbrain has challenged the Ruby community to
improve its documentation</a>, but some people were asking about how to do so.
So I made a video!</p>

<p>Some small errata: drbrain has informed me that he should edit the Changelog,
not me. So don&#8217;t do that. :)</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/23522731?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/23522731">How to contribute to Ruby&#8217;s documentation.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>


<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch me talk about it, here&#8217;s the same info, in text:</p>

<p>Getting the Ruby source is pretty easy. You can find it on GitHub, here:
<a href="http://github.com/ruby/ruby">http://github.com/ruby/ruby</a> . Click the &#8220;fork&#8221; button and clone down your
own fork:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/ruby.git
</code></pre>

<p>After that&#8217;s done, type <code>cd ruby</code> and add the main project as an upstream. This will
let you keep up-to-date with the latest changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git

$ git fetch upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Okay! Now that you&#8217;re all set up, poke around and find something that needs
documented. I like to just look through the source, but you can also look
<a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/documentation_coverage.txt">here</a> for a list of things that have no docs. Documentation is written in
rdoc, and I&#8217;d check the recent commits that drbrain has been making to guide
you in style. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/071a678a156dde974d8e470b659c89cb02b07b3b">This commit</a>, for example, is a pretty good template. You
can also check out the formatting guides <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html">here</a>. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/Ruby.html">this</a>
which explains some directives for .rb files and <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/C.html">this</a> which handles
directives for .c files.</p>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve made a change to the documentation, you can regenerate the
docs by using rdoc. First, grab the latest version from rubygems:</p>

<p>   $ gem install rdoc</p>

<p>Always best to have the latest tools. Now do this to generate the docs:</p>

<pre><code>$ rdoc --o tmpdoc lib/rss*
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m passing it in an output directory with op, since the doc directory is not
an rdoc directory. rdoc will complain and refuse to overwrite those files,
which is a good thing. I&#8217;m also passing in a pattern of what to compile
documentation for, compiling all of it takes a few minutes! In this case, I
chose to document the rss library.</p>

<p>Now you have a website in rdocout. Open up its index.html, and poke around for
what you&#8217;ve changed. If it all looks good, you&#8217;re ready to make a patch!</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -r rdocout

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "adding documentation for $SOMETHING"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have two options here. One is to simply push the change up to GitHub,
and make a pull request.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; aaand pull request. The core Ruby development doesn&#8217;t really happen on
GitHub though, and so your patch may take a while to get included. If you
really want to do it right, submit a patch to RedMine. We&#8217;ll use git to make
this patch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git format-patch HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>This says &#8220;make a patch out of the last commit.&#8221; It&#8217;ll tell you a file name,
it should start with 000.</p>

<p>Now, sign up for the Ruby RedMine <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/account/register">here</a>. Once you&#8217;ve clicked the
confirmation email, <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-19/issues/new">open a new ticket</a>, and assign it to Eric Hodel,
category DOC, and give it your Ruby version, even though it&#8217;s not a big deal
here. Click &#8216;choose file&#8217; and pick your patch, then &#8216;create and continue&#8217; and
BAM! You&#8217;re done!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s all pitch in and make this the best documented Ruby release ever! In
writing documentation, you might even find some things that you&#8217;d like to help
improve. ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone. A lot of people have been asking me about <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> lately,
so I figured I&#8217;d tell a little bit of the story as it&#8217;s gone down so far.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>First, here&#8217;s some numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users: 4553</li>
<li>Uniques: 25,000</li>
<li>Pageviews: 119,385</li>
<li>Pages/visit: 4.77</li>
<li>Statuses posted: 9387</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s some fun info: stats on statuses by language:</p>

<ul>
<li>german 118</li>
<li>russian 1355</li>
<li>none 97 &lt;- ha!</li>
<li>english 4836</li>
<li>spanish 1412</li>
<li>dutch 98</li>
<li>french 1155</li>
<li>portuguese 272</li>
<li>farsi 66</li>
<li>pinyin 1</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Lines, by committer:</p>

<ul>
<li>28 AndrewVos</li>
<li>124 BRIMIL01</li>
<li>6 Blaine Cook</li>
<li>107 Brendan Taylor</li>

<li>28 james cook</li>
<li>56 kat</li>

<p>Also, wilkie has a lot more code in the 3 gems that we build off of, for our
ostatus implementation.</p>

<p>That makes for 29 unique committers. These stats were generated by git-blame.</p>

<p>Just over 200 pull requests</p>

<p>872 commits</p>

<h2>The deal with Heroku</h2>

<p>Crazy! Such good stuff. I&#8217;m really excited as to how it&#8217;s going, but there
were a few rocky points along the way as well. Some people saw me tweeting in
frustration with Heroku, so here&#8217;s the skinny:</p>

<p>On Sunday, for some reason, our 3 line app.js file, as well as our
favicon.ico, started to take 60 seconds to respond. This meant that a dyno was
getting tied up, and since Heroku changed the way their mesh works, they kept
routing requests to these screwed up dynos. This caused a rash of 500 errors,
and I frantically filed a support ticket. This was the first time I&#8217;d had a
paid app on Heroku, and they&#8217;ve always been fantastic. The Hackety Hack site
was on the free account, and performed beautifully, with similar traffic.</p>

<p>What it boils down to is this, though: Heroku took about 22 hours to respond
to my support ticket, in any way. Not like &#8220;we&#8217;re looking at it, but it&#8217;s
Sunday, so it&#8217;ll take a while.&#8221; Crickets. Meanwhile, the errors kept
happening. Eventually, I heard something from them, where they pretty much
said &#8216;I see other errors, try fixing those.&#8217; with no response on the actual
root cause. I got an email from a Level2 person who promised to investigate
and escalate, but by now, I still haven&#8217;t heard.</p>

<p>I also had a smaller issue with MongoHQ. To their credit, I heard back Sunday
night, and the issue with them was an annoyance, not a showstopper. I ended up
hearing from the CEO, who ended up following up with me multiple times, and in
a pretty timely fashion.</p>

<p>So, we moved our hosting away from Heroku and onto Duostack. Now, full
disclosure: I&#8217;m friends with the guys from DuoStack. That said, they took care
of me. I found a small bug in their platform when deploying the app, but
everything&#8217;s gone really well. Bunches of users have commented on how fast the
site is now, and I&#8217;ve been really happy with it so far. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s next for <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a>: The biggest thing is getting to
100% ostatus compliance. We spent lots of time this week getting screwed over
by a bug in Google&#8217;s hub implementation, but now that it&#8217;s all taken care of
now. While we work on that, we&#8217;re also getting ready to deploy a statusnet
compliant API, so people can use statusnet clients on mobile and desktop. This
is huge for me, as I&#8217;m really missing notifications.</p>

<p>Other than that, just keep using it! Tell your friends! If you code, come join
us on the IRC (#rstatus on freenode), and help file bugs and patch them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whew.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">following me on Twitter</a> at all lately, you&#8217;ll know that
I&#8217;ve been working hard on a new project lately. Tonight, even though it&#8217;s
late, I&#8217;m finally getting it out there. Please welcome <a href="http://rstat.us/">http://rstat.us/</a>
to the world! (as soon as the DNS updates. ;) )</p>

<p><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is a micro-blogging service, just like Twitter. There&#8217;s one big
difference, though: it is distributed. Oh, and it&#8217;s 100% open source. So two
things. It&#8217;s also integrated with Facebook and Twitter, so you can just log in
with either of those accounts, and it&#8217;ll syndicate your posts. Well, just to
Twitter right now, but we&#8217;re getting there.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the other cool thing: Want to own your data? You can actually <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us">get the
code</a> and run a copy yourself! But you won&#8217;t get left out: you can follow
anyone else that uses the <a href="http://ostatus.org/">ostatus</a> protocol, like <a href="http://identi.ca/">http://identi.ca/</a>,
and it&#8217;ll Just Work. You just have to grab the URL to their feed, put it in,
and it&#8217;s all good! But you probably shouldn&#8217;t do that yet. We&#8217;re still working
on some features.</p>

<p><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is still very much alpha quality. 7 or 8 of my best friends and
I have been fighting off sleep, food, and tests for the last two weeks to put
this together. Please <a href="http://rstat.us/">give it a try</a> and let me know what you think, tell
me if you can break it, or anything else that&#8217;s particularly interesting. If
you&#8217;re the coding type, please check out the <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/wiki">wiki</a> for a big old list of
stuff we&#8217;d like to do.</p>

<p>Oh, and of course, you should <a href="http://rstat.us/users/steveklabnik">follow me on rstat.us</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve heard <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/">Ruby Mendicant University</a> (also known as RMU, not to confuse
you Robert Morris alums!) described as &#8220;the best kept secret of the Ruby
community.&#8221; High praise, indeed. If you haven&#8217;t heard about RMU before, check
out this presentation by Andrew Cox: </p>

<p>TL;DR: RMU is a free, online &#8216;unversity&#8217; from Gregory Brown, author of &#8216;Ruby
Best Practices.&#8217; You enter an intermediate Rubyist, and you exit an expert. </p>

<p>Anyway, RMU recently announced that <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/changelog/visiting-teacher-2011-t2-steve-klabnik">I&#8217;ll be their first visiting teacher</a>.
Basically, I&#8217;ll be hanging out, giving advice, and just generally being even
more accessible to RMU students than I already am. Greg and I have talked a
lot about education, Ruby, and a lot of other things&#8230; between Hackety&#8217;s
&#8216;nothing to intermediate&#8217; and RMU&#8217;s &#8216;intermediate to expert&#8217; approaches to
learning, anyone wanting to get up to speed with Ruby should have no shortage
of resources at their disposal.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re feeling like you&#8217;ve got the hang of Ruby, but want to take it to the
next level, <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/admissions">applications are open</a>! Hopefully I&#8217;ll see you there.</p>
