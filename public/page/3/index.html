  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Update!</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m now making it even easier than this: <a href="/2011/08/22/im-making-it-dead-simple-to-contribute-to-ruby-s-documentation.html">Read my new post about how
I&#8217;ll do this for you</a>. That said, if you want to do it yourself, the following will tell you how.</p>

<h3>Original Article</h3>

<p>Ruby 1.9.3 is coming out soon! <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/2011/05/09/ruby-1-9-3-documentation-challenge">drbrain has challenged the Ruby community to
improve its documentation</a>, but some people were asking about how to do so.
So I made a video!</p>

<p>Some small errata: drbrain has informed me that he should edit the Changelog,
not me. So don&#8217;t do that. :)</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/23522731?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/23522731">How to contribute to Ruby&#8217;s documentation.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>


<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch me talk about it, here&#8217;s the same info, in text:</p>

<p>Getting the Ruby source is pretty easy. You can find it on GitHub, here:
<a href="http://github.com/ruby/ruby">http://github.com/ruby/ruby</a> . Click the &#8220;fork&#8221; button and clone down your
own fork:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/ruby.git
</code></pre>

<p>After that&#8217;s done, type <code>cd ruby</code> and add the main project as an upstream. This will
let you keep up-to-date with the latest changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git

$ git fetch upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Okay! Now that you&#8217;re all set up, poke around and find something that needs
documented. I like to just look through the source, but you can also look
<a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/documentation_coverage.txt">here</a> for a list of things that have no docs. Documentation is written in
rdoc, and I&#8217;d check the recent commits that drbrain has been making to guide
you in style. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/071a678a156dde974d8e470b659c89cb02b07b3b">This commit</a>, for example, is a pretty good template. You
can also check out the formatting guides <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html">here</a>. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/Ruby.html">this</a>
which explains some directives for .rb files and <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/C.html">this</a> which handles
directives for .c files.</p>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve made a change to the documentation, you can regenerate the
docs by using rdoc. First, grab the latest version from rubygems:</p>

<p>   $ gem install rdoc</p>

<p>Always best to have the latest tools. Now do this to generate the docs:</p>

<pre><code>$ rdoc --o tmpdoc lib/rss*
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m passing it in an output directory with op, since the doc directory is not
an rdoc directory. rdoc will complain and refuse to overwrite those files,
which is a good thing. I&#8217;m also passing in a pattern of what to compile
documentation for, compiling all of it takes a few minutes! In this case, I
chose to document the rss library.</p>

<p>Now you have a website in rdocout. Open up its index.html, and poke around for
what you&#8217;ve changed. If it all looks good, you&#8217;re ready to make a patch!</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -r rdocout

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "adding documentation for $SOMETHING"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have two options here. One is to simply push the change up to GitHub,
and make a pull request.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; aaand pull request. The core Ruby development doesn&#8217;t really happen on
GitHub though, and so your patch may take a while to get included. If you
really want to do it right, submit a patch to RedMine. We&#8217;ll use git to make
this patch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git format-patch HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>This says &#8220;make a patch out of the last commit.&#8221; It&#8217;ll tell you a file name,
it should start with 000.</p>

<p>Now, sign up for the Ruby RedMine <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/account/register">here</a>. Once you&#8217;ve clicked the
confirmation email, <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-19/issues/new">open a new ticket</a>, and assign it to Eric Hodel,
category DOC, and give it your Ruby version, even though it&#8217;s not a big deal
here. Click &#8216;choose file&#8217; and pick your patch, then &#8216;create and continue&#8217; and
BAM! You&#8217;re done!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s all pitch in and make this the best documented Ruby release ever! In
writing documentation, you might even find some things that you&#8217;d like to help
improve. ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone. A lot of people have been asking me about <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> lately,
so I figured I&#8217;d tell a little bit of the story as it&#8217;s gone down so far.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>First, here&#8217;s some numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users: 4553</li>
<li>Uniques: 25,000</li>
<li>Pageviews: 119,385</li>
<li>Pages/visit: 4.77</li>
<li>Statuses posted: 9387</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s some fun info: stats on statuses by language:</p>

<ul>
<li>german 118</li>
<li>russian 1355</li>
<li>none 97 &lt;- ha!</li>
<li>english 4836</li>

<li>french 1155</li>
<li>portuguese 272</li>
<li>farsi 66</li>
<li>pinyin 1</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Lines, by committer:</p>

ostatus implementation.</p>

<p>That makes for 29 unique committers. These stats were generated by git-blame.</p>

<p>Just over 200 pull requests</p>

<h2>The deal with Heroku</h2>

<p>Crazy! Such good stuff. I&#8217;m really excited as to how it&#8217;s going, but there
were a few rocky points along the way as well. Some people saw me tweeting in
frustration with Heroku, so here&#8217;s the skinny:</p>

<p>On Sunday, for some reason, our 3 line app.js file, as well as our
favicon.ico, started to take 60 seconds to respond. This meant that a dyno was
getting tied up, and since Heroku changed the way their mesh works, they kept
routing requests to these screwed up dynos. This caused a rash of 500 errors,
and I frantically filed a support ticket. This was the first time I&#8217;d had a
paid app on Heroku, and they&#8217;ve always been fantastic. The Hackety Hack site
was on the free account, and performed beautifully, with similar traffic.</p>

<p>What it boils down to is this, though: Heroku took about 22 hours to respond
to my support ticket, in any way. Not like &#8220;we&#8217;re looking at it, but it&#8217;s
Sunday, so it&#8217;ll take a while.&#8221; Crickets. Meanwhile, the errors kept
happening. Eventually, I heard something from them, where they pretty much
said &#8216;I see other errors, try fixing those.&#8217; with no response on the actual
root cause. I got an email from a Level2 person who promised to investigate
and escalate, but by now, I still haven&#8217;t heard.</p>

<p>I also had a smaller issue with MongoHQ. To their credit, I heard back Sunday
night, and the issue with them was an annoyance, not a showstopper. I ended up
hearing from the CEO, who ended up following up with me multiple times, and in
a pretty timely fashion.</p>

<p>So, we moved our hosting away from Heroku and onto Duostack. Now, full
disclosure: I&#8217;m friends with the guys from DuoStack. That said, they took care
of me. I found a small bug in their platform when deploying the app, but
everything&#8217;s gone really well. Bunches of users have commented on how fast the
site is now, and I&#8217;ve been really happy with it so far. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s next for <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a>: The biggest thing is getting to
100% ostatus compliance. We spent lots of time this week getting screwed over
by a bug in Google&#8217;s hub implementation, but now that it&#8217;s all taken care of
now. While we work on that, we&#8217;re also getting ready to deploy a statusnet
compliant API, so people can use statusnet clients on mobile and desktop. This
is huge for me, as I&#8217;m really missing notifications.</p>

<p>Other than that, just keep using it! Tell your friends! If you code, come join
us on the IRC (#rstatus on freenode), and help file bugs and patch them!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whew.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">following me on Twitter</a> at all lately, you&#8217;ll know that
I&#8217;ve been working hard on a new project lately. Tonight, even though it&#8217;s
late, I&#8217;m finally getting it out there. Please welcome <a href="http://rstat.us/">http://rstat.us/</a>
to the world! (as soon as the DNS updates. ;) )</p>

<p><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is a micro-blogging service, just like Twitter. There&#8217;s one big
difference, though: it is distributed. Oh, and it&#8217;s 100% open source. So two
things. It&#8217;s also integrated with Facebook and Twitter, so you can just log in
with either of those accounts, and it&#8217;ll syndicate your posts. Well, just to
Twitter right now, but we&#8217;re getting there.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the other cool thing: Want to own your data? You can actually <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us">get the
code</a> and run a copy yourself! But you won&#8217;t get left out: you can follow
anyone else that uses the <a href="http://ostatus.org/">ostatus</a> protocol, like <a href="http://identi.ca/">http://identi.ca/</a>,
and it&#8217;ll Just Work. You just have to grab the URL to their feed, put it in,
and it&#8217;s all good! But you probably shouldn&#8217;t do that yet. We&#8217;re still working
on some features.</p>

<p><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is still very much alpha quality. 7 or 8 of my best friends and
I have been fighting off sleep, food, and tests for the last two weeks to put
this together. Please <a href="http://rstat.us/">give it a try</a> and let me know what you think, tell
me if you can break it, or anything else that&#8217;s particularly interesting. If
you&#8217;re the coding type, please check out the <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/wiki">wiki</a> for a big old list of
stuff we&#8217;d like to do.</p>

<p>Oh, and of course, you should <a href="http://rstat.us/users/steveklabnik">follow me on rstat.us</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve heard <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/">Ruby Mendicant University</a> (also known as RMU, not to confuse
you Robert Morris alums!) described as &#8220;the best kept secret of the Ruby
community.&#8221; High praise, indeed. If you haven&#8217;t heard about RMU before, check
out this presentation by Andrew Cox: </p>

<p>TL;DR: RMU is a free, online &#8216;unversity&#8217; from Gregory Brown, author of &#8216;Ruby
Best Practices.&#8217; You enter an intermediate Rubyist, and you exit an expert. </p>

<p>Anyway, RMU recently announced that <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/changelog/visiting-teacher-2011-t2-steve-klabnik">I&#8217;ll be their first visiting teacher</a>.
Basically, I&#8217;ll be hanging out, giving advice, and just generally being even
more accessible to RMU students than I already am. Greg and I have talked a
lot about education, Ruby, and a lot of other things&#8230; between Hackety&#8217;s
&#8216;nothing to intermediate&#8217; and RMU&#8217;s &#8216;intermediate to expert&#8217; approaches to
learning, anyone wanting to get up to speed with Ruby should have no shortage
of resources at their disposal.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re feeling like you&#8217;ve got the hang of Ruby, but want to take it to the
next level, <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/admissions">applications are open</a>! Hopefully I&#8217;ll see you there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this post for a while.</p>

<p>I freaking love Hacker News. It&#8217;s my favorite place on the Internet. It&#8217;s
incredibly valuable. I have learned so much from my time there.  With that
said, I feel like it&#8217;s taken up too much of my time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to accomplish things. I got accepted to grad school. I&#8217;m trying to
rebuild Shoes. I&#8217;m working on improving Hackety. I&#8217;m finding that I don&#8217;t have
enough hours in the day to accomplish the things I want to accomplish. And
arguing for the hundredth time about how artists will survive in a post-IP
world, or how to get your first couple of users, or whatever it is that Google
or Apple did this week hasn&#8217;t gotten boring yet, and that&#8217;s a problem.</p>

<p>The only respectable solution is to go cold-turkey for a while.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing good on some of my new years&#8217; resolutions, and bad on others.
I haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time writing lately, and I have only been doing okay
at my writing. Hacker News is cutting into that. I feel like I&#8217;m using it in
the same way some use TV. Yeah, it&#8217;s significantly deeper, but I really should
be reading more books and less HN. At least, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s right for me right
now.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be gone forever. I just need to spend more time elsewhere.</p>

<p>With that said, I&#8217;ve been spending a <em>lot</em> of time on Shoes. I&#8217;ll just leave
this here: <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify">https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify</a></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve almost always been in a habit of reading. When I was younger, I spent a
lot of time in the library. I&#8217;d just grab an entire series of novels, and read
them all, right in a row. Sometimes I&#8217;d end up reading non-fiction too. I
ended up with a lot of books on software.</p>

<p>Then my local library got Internet access. Slowly, I started to spend less
time in the stacks and more in front of a terminal. This wasn&#8217;t a bad thing; I
still kept reading. What&#8217;s more, what was previously a one way street turned
into two: I didn&#8217;t just read the Internet, I wrote it. I spent hours and hours
discussing the things I&#8217;d read with others.</p>

<p>In any case, as the years flew by, the things that I&#8217;ve been reading have
become less and less substantial. Current events are fine and all, and
pictures of cute cats are nice, but I feel like the volume of what I&#8217;ve been
reading has gone up, but the quality has gone down. It happens. I can&#8217;t really
be snide about not owning a TV while being subscribed to
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu">/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu</a>. Reddit somehow has morphed into a place where you
can feel superior, but it&#8217;s really just the same exact thing in different
clothing. Combine this general unease with my aspirations for grad school in
the fall, as well as my renewed interest in political philosophy, and my need
to hit the books has become readily apparent.</p>

<p>Luckily, I have an ally in this quest, and Jamie has given me a reading list.
Since reading and writing are two sides of a single coin, I&#8217;ll be writing
about the things that I read here. Like many other things I&#8217;ve written about
in the past, I&#8217;m sure that putting my thoughts down on paper (?) will help to
gel my understanding and thoughts. First up: Michel Foucault&#8217;s &#8220;Discipline and
Punish.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get right to it: I really enjoyed reading this book. It&#8217;s partially
because it took a lot of random things that I kind of knew and tied them to
some experiences that I&#8217;ve had in a meaningful way. It&#8217;s also partially
because I have a substantial infatuation with the conspiratorial; I re-read
&#8220;1984&#8221; every year, and I often think about its all-knowing, all-seeing
telescreen imagery when discussing anything vaguely political. &#8220;Discipline and
Punish&#8221; gave me the same sort of images, but they were fewer, and more firmly
rooted in history and reality. The book opens with a section named &#8220;Torture,&#8221;
and the scene of Robert-François Damiens&#8217; punishments for attempted regicide.
I&#8217;m sure that before the release of &#8220;Saw,&#8221; these images were even more
shocking:</p>

<p>  &#8230; he was to be &#8216;taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing but a shirt, holding a torch of burningwax weighing two pounds&#8217;; then, &#8216;in the said cart, to the Place de Greve, where, on a scaffold that will be erected there, the flesh will be torn from his breasts, arms, thighs, and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be torn away, poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax, and sulphur melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes, and his ashes thrown to the winds.</p>

<p>Let it never be said that the people of 1757 were not thorough. Regardless, by
January of 1840, we&#8217;d transitioned to a prison system that looks pretty much
the same as it does now. The book&#8217;s primary theme is discussing how we got
from point A to point B, and then examining the &#8216;why&#8217; to explain how modern
society has a new sovereign institution: the &#8216;carceral system.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before we can examine that question, though, we need to ask why we used
torture as a form of punishment in the first place. The reasoning is actually
straightforward: during the period of monarchy, everything revolves around the
monarch. He is sovereign in a more absolute way than we even initially think
of; the pop-culture image of a king has more to do with something of a
popularity contest or that he&#8217;s simply the guy on the top of the pyramid, but
the nature of a monarch&#8217;s power runs more deeply than that. It was called
&#8216;divine right&#8217; for a reason, the physical body of the sovereign was the
representation of God himself, and since the entire world belongs to God, thus
it belongs to and is a part of the monarch. It reminds me of the kind of
doublethink necessary to grasp the Catholic conception of the Holy Trinity, in
this case God the Father, the king his son, and the world rather than a Holy
Ghost. All one, yet three at the same time. In any case, if the land itself is
the literal body of the king, then any transgression is an act of defiance not
only of the rule of the monarch, but is making war upon God himself. And since
damage has been done to the body of God, so must an equivalent exchange be
made with the body of the aggressor. Torture also has an element of the
theatrical to it, and therefore demonstrates to all of those watching that
they must also comply with the rule of law or face the consequences.</p>

<p>However, eventually, torture became socially inconvenient. Basically, it was a
case of the Streisand Effect: when you place that much attention on someone,
you create a forum for sympathizers to create romantic images of their fallen
hero. There&#8217;s a great historical example of this in the Christian mythos:
consider the polarizing effect that Christ&#8217;s torture on the cross maintains to
this day. History is littered with the songs of fallen heros, and a call to
follow in their stead. Eventually, whenever a new convict was to be strung up
at a gallows, there&#8217;d be a state of disarray. Foucault describes several
images of rioters throwing stones and even in some cases killing the
executioner.</p>

<p>As a result of this, the nature of punishment slowly changed. Reformists
argued that punishment was metered out unevenly, and inconsistently. Thus in
the same way that monarchy gave way to democracy, the absolute right of the
king to punish became distributed as well. However, centralized and
distributed systems are quite different, and require different constructs to
operate properly. Therefore, a distributed form of the right to punish would
need some mechanism by which to operate. This mechanism is termed &#8220;discipline&#8221;
by Foucault. Discipline creates a certain order all by itself, and he uses a
great example of monks and monasteries to illustrate the concept of
discipline. Think about all of these things that we consider virtuous:</p>

<ul>
<li>Studying is a disciplined form of reading</li>
<li>Dieting is discipline applied to eating</li>
<li>The image of a soldier is almost entirely one of discipline</li>
<li>Morality is discipline applied to all of life</li>
<li>Exercise is disciplined form of the body</li>
</ul>


<p>But discipline has even greater roots in our society. Think about Taylor&#8217;s
Scientific Management, for example: it&#8217;s a means of imposing discipline on
workers to maximize their production. Schooling is a way of giving children a
&#8216;structured environment&#8217; (structure seems to be synonymous with discipline in
many cases) to develop in. Churches are places for the soul to become
disciplined.</p>

<p>Submitting to discipline has deeper psychological effects as well. It creates
the idea of a division: there&#8217;s those who follow the rules, and those that
disregard them. And since we&#8217;ve established that those who follow the rules
are virtuous, those who don&#8217;t must not be. Since those that don&#8217;t follow the
rules are doing bad things, they should be subject to punishment, so that they
can remain disciplined. And thus the system of rules can be used as the
distributed form of this right to punish, replacing the absolute right of the
monarch. Submitting to this mentality makes people into &#8216;docile bodies&#8217; that
perfectly fit into this worldview.</p>

<p>As an example of how far this disciplinary approach has gone, Foucault
presents the Panopticon, which was a prison shaped like a pie, with a tower in
the middle. Prisoners would be able to observe others directly across from
themselves, and the guard who may or may not be in the tower would be able to
watch all of the prisoners at once. Since you couldn&#8217;t tell if the guard was
in the tower or not, discipline would become internalized, since you always
had to assume that Big Brother is watching you&#8230; This way of thinking about
society ends up creating an all-encompassing &#8216;carceral system&#8217; that we now
live in.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that this carceral system is total and absolutely
permeating every aspect of society, yet they aren&#8217;t presented as such.
Foucault specifically mentions that it&#8217;s important to consider that the
delinquent are still a part of the system, and not outside of it. Yet we&#8217;re
constantly presented with images that serve to present the idea that there&#8217;s a
&#8216;criminal underworld,&#8217; that those who lead a life of crime are part of a
shadowy alternate universe. Foucault refers to this idea as &#8216;enclosure&#8217;:
&#8220;Discipline sometimes requires enclosure, the specification of a place
heterogeneous to all others and closed in upon itself. It is the protected
space of disciplinary monotony.&#8221; The enclosure embodies this separation, since
there&#8217;s a space both within and outside of the enclosure. A self and an Other.</p>

<p>&#8230; so yeah. That&#8217;s my summary. I&#8217;m still digesting a lot of this stuff, and
so I may have more to say about it later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year I&#8217;m happy to report that I have much more upbeat plans than last
year&#8217;s kind of sad post. With that said, here&#8217;s my 2011 goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I want to work for other people 2 days per week on average for the year.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to write something every day</p></li>
<li><p>I want to keep building on the initial success that Hackety Hack&#8217;s 1.0 launch
has brought. I&#8217;d like to get a new release out every month or so, with a 2.0 for
Christmas 2011.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to start exercising again. My current lifestyle is still too sedentary
for my liking.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to eat better.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to start logging my activities every day.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most of these are kinda standard. I used to go to the gym all the time, but
I&#8217;ve never eaten healthily. Both of these things are going to become more
important as I age, however, and so I&#8217;m starting to actually give them serious
consideration.</p>

<p>Hackety Hack had an impressive 1.0 launch, but I have lots of work to do.
Please check out the <a href="http://blog.hackety-hack.com/">Hackety Hack blog</a> tomorrow for a report on that.
Basically, I now have a sizable userbase to attend to, and they&#8217;ve found a
bunch of bugs that I need to iron out before starting to build more stuff.</p>

<p>The logging is an idea that I got from <a href="http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/">Sebastian Marshall</a>. We&#8217;ve had some
good conversation recently, and we talked briefly about the importance of
measuring things. You can only improve things if you know what&#8217;s actually
wrong&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be tracking the time that I do various activities, and
seeing if I can improve. If I feel this is working, I&#8217;ll write about it in a
month or so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already made some progress on all of these, actually. Obviously, most of
them can only truly be realized in a year&#8217;s time, but here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got
going:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve got my logging set up going. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to make it as
unobtrusive as possible, but I think I have a good first run at it.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve got a set up for the work situation, and if all goes well, that should
be accomplished. I originally thought I&#8217;d have to front-load a bit, but it
seems like I&#8217;ll be doing this most of the year.</p></li>
<li><p>Working that little will enable me to really accomplish my Hackety goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that Maria is graduated, she&#8217;s got some time to cook things, and she&#8217;s
also interested in eating better, and her habits are better than mine already.
Hopefully this will lead to success.</p></li>
<li><p>Logging should help keep my eyes on the prize for my exercise and writing goals.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, that&#8217;s it! Good luck with your goals in the new year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ll cut to the chase: I&#8217;ve stepped down as CTO of CloudFab. I don&#8217;t
want to discuss details, but life is too short to not be doing what
you want with it. And, after a period of careful thought and
consideration, it&#8217;s no longer the right thing for me. It was an
amicable parting, and my replacements are already in place, and doing
cool things. I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve accomplished, but it&#8217;s time  for me to
move on.</p>

<p>This raises the question: what am I moving on to? Here&#8217;s the answer:
Hackety Hack. What I truly care about is teaching, writing, and
discussing software. If I could do anything, I&#8217;d hack on Hackety,
share what I know with others, and keep learning and playing with new
things all day long.</p>

<p>However, there&#8217;s a certain question of sustainability here: I&#8217;m not
made of money, and I have lots of bills to pay. However, doing the
&#8216;obvious&#8217; thing would be really, truly wrong: Hackety Hack is not and
will never be a startup. It&#8217;s a social venture, if anything: it would
be absolutely unquestioningly wrong for me to ever ask anyone for a
single cent for it. It&#8217;d also be counterproductive: how could I share
programming with everyone if I excluded those without disposable
income?</p>

<p>So to this end, Hackety cannot be all that I do. And while I really
want to teach, I also have a lot to learn. Luckily, I have some great
allies in this area: I&#8217;ve been working alongside two teachers at the
University of Pittsburgh over the past month or so: one in the English
department, and one in the Computer Science department. In doing so,
I&#8217;ve come to realize that my place in life is actually in the middle:
while I love the theoretical side of CS, I&#8217;m actually much more
interested in the application. And teachers need to be effective
communicators, so investing in writing is absolutely worthwhile for
me. At the same time, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed every chance I&#8217;ve had to
write: there&#8217;s a reason I keep three blogs now! I&#8217;m also incredibly
interested in the parallels that exist between computer and human
languages. I like the comparison between refactoring and composition.
I think the two fields have a lot to learn from one another. It&#8217;s
something I&#8217;d like to explore more.</p>

<p>To do so, I&#8217;ll have to finish off my undergrad degree. Luckily, I&#8217;m
very close, so I&#8217;ll be doing that in the spring. Afterward, it&#8217;s my
intention to go to grad school in the English department, so I&#8217;m
furiously working on my application, with the help of the
aforementioned teacher. At the same time, I&#8217;ll possibly help teach or
TA classes in the CS department as well. I&#8217;m hoping to combine my
solid foundations in the hard sciences with the new perspective and
improved analysis that the humanities can offer.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that academia is where I want to stay forever, but I
think it&#8217;s a good place for me to grow for now. It&#8217;s time for me to
invest in myself a little. I think I&#8217;ll end up a much better person in
the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I find it incredibly hard not to be judgmental.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what part of my personality makes this happen, but even
when I try to curb tearing down other people, I end up doing it
anyway. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s just me, but I think part of the problem
is that these kinds of things are rewarded.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stevesajerk.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is me, being a jerk.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that I use my real name everywhere is to try to
improve the civility of my discourse. When you&#8217;re anonymous, it&#8217;s
really easy to be callous. And when I used a handle, I was even worse.
But even now, I can think of three times when I accidentally was mean
for basically no reason: That tweet, the Diaspora incident, and the
only Hacker News comment I&#8217;ve ever deleted.</p>

<p>In all three of these instances, it&#8217;s not so much that I was wrong.
It&#8217;s that I ended up presenting my criticisms poorly. I think I did a
decent job with the Diaspora one, but people still took it the wrong
way, so I failed to communicate. I&#8217;m certainly not infallible. I
guarantee you there are n00b errors and security holes in my own
codebases. So I really shouldn&#8217;t be so quick to judge.
That&#8217;s all I have to say about that. I&#8217;ll just have to do better going
forward.</p>
