  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been joking for a while that I&#8217;d like to &#8220;move to the Internet.&#8221;
Generally I cite my familiarity and love with online culture as opposed to
American culture. I don&#8217;t really care what&#8217;s going on in &#8220;the real world,&#8221; as
I feel it&#8217;s kind of played out. The whole cycle of &#8220;fight wars, reduce
freedoms, sit in front of your TV&#8221; has gotten really boring quickly. I find
Internet culture to be more complex, entertaining, and useful. But I&#8217;m getting
way off topic, here.</p>

<p>As a programmer, one of the key skills I rely on daily is the ability to
recognize abstractions. Writing great code requires the ability to see
similarities in things, even when they may not be immediately apparent.
Lately, I&#8217;ve been giving a lot of thought to the idea of &#8220;living in the
cloud.&#8221; Primarily, cloud computing is about providing services on-demand, and
in the amount you need. Dynamic allocation. It&#8217;s generally great stuff, and
even though &#8220;the cloud&#8221; is a bit buzzwordy, it&#8217;s an awesome concept.</p>

<p>So what happens when we apply that to meatspace? What does &#8220;cloud living&#8221; look
like? &#8220;Cloud working&#8221;?</p>

<p>Living in the cloud would look a lot like the world Tim Ferriss encourages
with his whole lifestyle design concept, or at least the lifestyle he&#8217;s
designed for himself. Move around from place to place, live where you find
things interesting, reallocate yourself to a better place when the feeling
dictates. The concept of being a &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; certainly makes me think of
&#8220;living in the cloud.&#8221; Doing this right means giving up most material
possessions, as they impede freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of cloud living would be finding a way to make a
living while being location independent. There was a great article making the
rounds a while back called &#8221;<a href="http://romansnitko.posterous.com/jobs-dont-scale">Jobs don&#8217;t scale</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s only tangentially
related, but his point about working for other people certainly relates to
freedom of movement. If you have to convince your boss to let you work
remotely, it&#8217;s much harder than just doing it yourself.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#8217;m very attracted to all of this as an idea. I&#8217;d love to travel
the world, working from a different place every day, seeing new sights and
exploring new places. It requires re-thinking a lot of things about what it
means to work, how relationships work, friendships. Can you have kids if you
keep moving around from place to place? How can you stay connected to friends
if you never see them, because you&#8217;re halfway across the globe? Can your
significant other do the same thing? Can you get month to month leases easily?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still thinking about this as a concept, but I thought I&#8217;d share my
thoughts so far. I&#8217;m not moving around the world yet, but I am trying to
increase my own mobility as much as possible. I think I&#8217;m finally at a place
where I don&#8217;t care much for most of my possessions anymore&#8230; </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for this book for a while. &#8220;Rework&#8221; is the new book by Jason
Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson from 37signals. It hit stores on Tuesday.
Here&#8217;s a (non-affiliate) link to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_t1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1RRQJN39HSJ4SMVA2EM4&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Rework on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m down in Houston, Texas. I&#8217;m here for a
few days before heading over to Austin for SXSW. There&#8217;s a lot of really cool
start up stuff, as well as 3D people, and a friend of mine. It&#8217;s been a good
trip so far. But even with waking up at 3am, connecting flights, and a few
hours of driving, I still managed to find a spare moment to head over to a
Borders and grab a copy of Rework. And even though I&#8217;m running all over town,
Nick is driving, so I&#8217;ve been able to read all of Rework in between lunches
and networking events.</p>

<p>Rework is interesting. I described it earlier today <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/10281523422">as a philosophy text</a>,
and I feel that description is absolutely apt. It&#8217;s 37signals in its purest,
most potent form. If you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>, this territory will
be familiar. In fact, a lot of it is basically the same. I&#8217;d be lying if I
told you otherwise. The real truth is that it doesn&#8217;t matter. People who don&#8217;t
already know and love 37signals won&#8217;t have read Getting Real, and so this
stuff will be novel to them. People who do won&#8217;t mind re-reading this
information again, as they&#8217;ve bought into the philosophy. And an update isn&#8217;t
a bad thing, either. What makes Rework interesting is how it&#8217;s different from
Getting Real, not what&#8217;s the same.</p>

<p>I thought it&#8217;d be most interesting to talk about Rework in the context of it&#8217;s
own philosophy. I think there are three points in particular in the book
itself that point out just why this book is so good. The first is an old
37signals standby, the other two are new.</p>

<h3>Build half a product, not a half-assed product</h3>

<p>This got <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">a section devoted to it in Getting Real</a>. Here&#8217;s the core idea:</p>

<blockquote><p>Throw in every decent idea that comes along and you&#8217;ll just wind up with a
half-assed version of your product. What you really want to do is build half a
product that kicks ass.</p></blockquote>

<p>They mention that Rework used to be twice as big. The next to last draft was
57,000 words, and the final draft was 27,000. This is the biggest difference
between the two books. It&#8217;s the most pure dosage of Kool-Aid I&#8217;ve ever read.
Each section feels finely honed. They&#8217;re all either one, two, or three pages,
and an accompanying picture. This book is about what&#8217;s worked for the company
so far over its lifetime, and this refinement process is clearly demonstrated
here.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always easy to ask for more. I&#8217;m really curious about the things that
were cut. Were there more sections? Was each section twice as long? A little
of both? At the same time, this exactly exemplifies the thinking this section
is railing against. If the book was twice as long, would I have learned twice
as much? Probably not. YAGNI.</p>

<h3>Decommoditize your product</h3>

<blockquote><p>Make you part of your product or service. Inject what&#8217;s unique about the way
you think into what you sell.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is something that these guys do really well. It&#8217;s part of having such
strong opinions, and sharing them with the world. Everyone knows who 37signals
is and what they stand for. If I wrote each chapter of Rework into a blog
post, you&#8217;d still recognize it as their philosophy. It also comes through in
the writing. They mention in the notes that Matthew Linderman helped them pull
their distinct styles of writing into a more cohesive whole. He did a good
job, and didn&#8217;t let the voice get lost in the editing.</p>

<h3>Out-teach your competition</h3>

<blockquote><p>Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that big
companies can&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

<p>Teaching is a topic I&#8217;ve been getting more and more into lately. Hackety Hack
is about teaching; when I speak, I&#8217;m teaching; this blog is about teaching.
Rework is about teaching the lessons 37signals have learned about business to
the world. A lot of Signal vs. Noise is about teaching. It&#8217;s a great way to
get people to recognize you, and a great way to give back. The world can
always use more great teachers.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason I&#8217;m up late, writing this review. I couldn&#8217;t put Rework down.
I enjoyed revisiting the old topics; the new ones are still tumbling around in
my brain. I&#8217;m sure this book is going to spawn a bunch of posts on this blog
in the future, as I add my own thoughts to the stuff I&#8217;ve learned.
I&#8217;d recommend this book to anyone who&#8217;s working in the business world or doing
a startup, even if they hate that term. It&#8217;ll give you a lot of interesting
thoughts to chew on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wonder why some websites are so addictive? Certain sites always keep you
going back, time after time after time. Well, I can&#8217;t speak for all of them,
but there&#8217;s a subtle reason that some sites draw your attention on such a
repeated basis: They&#8217;re actually games.</p>

<h2>Wait, games?</h2>

<p>Try a little thought experiment: If I say, &#8220;Yeah, he&#8217;s a ______ addict,&#8221; what
are the first few things that pop into your mind? For me, top two are &#8220;heroin&#8221;
and &#8220;World of Warcraft.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what that says about me as a person, but
ignore that for now. What makes these two things so addicting? Why are they
basically synonymous with the word &#8220;addict&#8221;? Lots of people smoke pot. Lots of
people play Call of Duty. Lots do both, and in copious amounts. So why don&#8217;t
they get the same label?</p>

<h2>Heroin: it&#8217;s a hell of a drug</h2>

<p>Yeah, that reference is to cocaine, another famously addictive substance. Oh
well.</p>

<p>Heroin is the poster child for addiction because it&#8217;s got a built-in viral
loop. That sentence sounds ridiculous, but it&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s very easy to start
out with, as it&#8217;s snorted. No scary needles or anything. You get high really
quickly, due to its chemical properties combined with the fact that your nose
is already close to your brain. It gives a really intense high that is also
fairly short. As you do it, you develop both a psychological addiction as well
as a tolerance. You simultaneously develop a deep desire for more of the drug
as you need a larger quantity of the drug to get the same high. Eventually, it
becomes more and more difficult, but you&#8217;re so addicted that you get over your
fear of needles and start mainlining.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft works the same way. It&#8217;s easy to try, as there are
mechanisms to invite your friends, and the system requirements are fairly low
for a video game. The first few quests are super easy, and so you hit that
quick reward. You get addicted to &#8220;Ding!&#8221; but it takes longer and longer every
time you do it. Eventually, you max out on levels and have to start doing
other things to get your fix. It may sound funny, but it&#8217;s absolutely true.
People talk about &#8220;relapsing.&#8221; They speak of &#8220;craving.&#8221; That&#8217;s why WoW has so
many subscribers.</p>

<h2>How to replicate this success</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t guarantee that you&#8217;ll be able to make your site as addictive as heroin
is, but many sites use the same basic psychology to keep you coming back. Game
mechanics are one of the tools they use to develop that psychological
addiction. This is something we&#8217;ve been seeing more and more of lately, but it
isn&#8217;t really being talked about explicitly as a major trend. I really think
that this stuff is really important and useful.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different mechanisms that web sites can incorporate that
fall under the realm of &#8220;game mechanics:&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Collectibles: <em>Any sort of item you can accumulate. Sometimes comes in &#8220;sets,&#8221; which are finite lists.</em></li>
<li>Points: A concrete number that lets you compare two people. </li>
<li>Levels: A target number of points, you gain the &#8220;level&#8221; when you go over that number.</li>
<li>Trophies: A special kind of level that&#8217;s unrelated to points. You get it for some other arbitrary reason.</li>
<li>Rankings: A place where you can go to see how many points, levels, and trophies others have</li>
<li>Tournaments: A competition between people.</li>
</ul>


<p>We&#8217;ve all heard these terms used in games. But in web sites? Okay, let&#8217;s try
those things again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collectibles: Gowalla items. Facebook &#8220;Gifts&#8221;</li>
<li>Points: Twitter followers. Facebook friends. Number of feedbacks. Reddit Karma.</li>
<li>Levels: eBay &#8220;Power Sellers.&#8221; Foursquare &#8220;Super Users.&#8221;</li>
<li>Trophies: Badges, of any kind. &#8220;Achievements&#8221;</li>
<li>Rankings: FourSquare&#8217;s Leaderboard. Klout. Listorious. Hacker News&#8217; top list.</li>
<li>Tournaments: I actually can&#8217;t come up with a good example of this. Thoughts?</li>
</ul>


<p>The same feedback loop happens on these websites. You say something
interesting on Twitter, you gain another follower or two. You say something
else, another follower. You check in, oh look, you&#8217;re the mayor! You sell an
extra hundred things and get your Power Seller discount.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the hard stuff. It&#8217;ll get you hooked, and coming back for more.</p>

<h2>Where&#8217;s all of this going?</h2>

<p>This is the current stuff that&#8217;s being done with game mechanics. But where
could we go, in the future?</p>

<p>A while back, there was a huge debacle over ReadWriteWeb and Facebook connect.
To give you the basic idea, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a> is a blog that talks about
everything Web2.0. They wrote an article entitled &#8221;<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">Facebook Wants to be your
One True Login</a>.&#8221; Read the comments. Notice something funny? Due to some
Google magic, if you were to Google &#8220;Facebook login&#8221; the day that was posted,
that article would appear at the top under the &#8220;Google News&#8221; results. Now, RWW
uses Facebook Connect for their commenting system, and a ton of people
apparently don&#8217;t know how to use the Internet. So when they said, &#8220;Hey, I
think I&#8217;ll go to Facebook today,&#8221; they Googled &#8220;facebook login,&#8221; clicked the
news story, and went to RWW. They then ignored that RWW is a blog completely
covered in red that looks nothing like Facebook, scrolled until they found the
Facebook icon, clicked it, logged in, and then said &#8220;wtf, this isn&#8217;t my
facebook? Why&#8217;d they change the interface again???&#8221; This happened a week after
a middle-sized interface upgrade on Facebook, for extra hilarity.</p>

<p>Now, I won&#8217;t comment on those people or that situation directly. But one of my
favorite Hacker News posters, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=patio11">patio11</a>, posted <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1119186">a really interesting
comment</a> about the situation. I&#8217;m linking to the person he&#8217;s responding to,
for context:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Pyre</em>: Facebook can&#8217;t improve their interface to make users not type
&#8220;facebook login&#8221; into Google as a way of accessing their site.</p>

<p><em>patio11</em>: That is a failure of the imagination. They certainly could &#8211;
whether it is worth doing or not is another question, but hey, that is what
God gave us A/B testing to figure out. </p>

<p>&#8220;Hey user, it looks like you came to us today from Google searching for
[Facebook login]. Did you know that there is a better way? Type
<a href="http://facebook.com">facebook.com</a> into [blah blah blah]. Try it now and we&#8217;ll give you 5 free
credits for [without loss of generality: FarmVille]!&#8221; </p>

<p>Great job! You should do that every time. If you do that to log into
Facebook the next five days you use the service, we&#8217;ll award you a Facebook
Diploma and give you another 10 free credits for [without loss of generality:
FarmVille]!&#8221; </p>

<p>On the back end, you show the above prompts to N% of your users who you
detect coming to the login page from Google search results (this is trivial &#8211;
check the referer). You then compare any user metric you want for the &#8220;Was
Shown Facebook Login Course&#8221; population and &#8220;Complete Facebook Login Course&#8221;
population with the population at large. Kill the test if it hurts your
metrics, deploy it sitewide if it helps them. </p></blockquote>

<p>How cool would that be? Now the game mechanics aren&#8217;t being used just to
increase engagement, but to actually teach people how to use your site or
service. It&#8217;s classical conditioning; reward people for doing the right thing,
and they&#8217;ll keep doing the right thing.</p>

<h2>Game mechanics are your MVP</h2>

<p>So how&#8217;s this stuff relevant to your startup? Well, I think this idea ties in
really well with the concept of a Minimum Viable Product. Here&#8217;s the idea:
Build your MVP, and then build game mechanics in. Unlock new features based on
game mechanics. This gives you a few advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your new users only get the most basic experience, which is still useful. It&#8217;s a simplified, streamlined experience.</li>
<li>Users only get the new features added that are relevant to how they use the site itself.</li>
<li>You can &#8220;fake it till you make it&#8221; by implementing the features that are most useful to your users. Is everyone getting Badge A and not Badge B? Implement Feature A Level 2 first!</li>
</ol>


<p>I think that this makes for a really strong experience, if done right.
Foursquare kind of does this already in a crude way with their Super User
features. But I think it could be taken to a whole new level.</p>

<p>Think about this:  Facebook, where you can only friend people, update your
profile, and send messages at first. Soon you unlock the ability to use
applications. Then the ability to create pages and groups. The interface
slowly unfolds in front of you. What about Reddit, where posting comments is
all you can do at first? A hundred upvotes gives you the ability to downvote.
Ten comments lets you post stories. (Hacker News sort of does this already,
with a minimum karma before downvoting is enabled.)</p>

<p>If you could pull it off, I think it&#8217;d make for a really compelling user
experience. It does bring one extra design skill that many people may not
have, though: balance. Game designers are used to this already, but your
potential &#8220;Power Users&#8221; might not like having to wait to get more advanced
features. Then again, this might also solve some issues, like spam. If you had
to have 100 positively moderated comments before posting a story on Digg, it&#8217;d
be much harder to just sign up for spam accounts to submit bogus stories.</p>

<p>This idea can be taken in a lot of different directions. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m only
barely scratching the surface with this idea, but I think it&#8217;ll go really far.
What do you think? Any interesting mechanics I&#8217;ve missed? Any really
interesting thoughts for how services can incorporate game mechanics? I&#8217;ve
decided to re-open comments, but if nobody uses them, I&#8217;ll just shut them off
again. Let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, when responding to a support request, it&#8217;s nice to see what your
users see. At the same time, you don&#8217;t want to ask your users for their
passwords, out of respect for their privacy. So what do you do?</p>

<p>Well, *NIX systems have a program called su.  Here&#8217;s what man su has to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>NAME
       su - run a shell with substitute user and group IDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS
       su [OPTION]&#8230; [-] [USER [ARG]&#8230;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION
       Change the effective user id and group id to that of USER.</p></blockquote>

<p>su can be thought of as &#8220;substitute user&#8221; or &#8220;switch user.&#8221; It&#8217;s a command
system administrators use to assume the identity of one of their users, or a
way for someone with the root password on the system to switch to the root
account itself. So how can we incorporate this into a web application?</p>

<p>Well, we want to first log ourselves out, and then log in as the user we&#8217;re
su-ing to. That&#8217;s it. The tricky part, however, comes in when we&#8217;re logging
in: as we said before, we don&#8217;t want to ask for their password. Luckily,
Authlogic provides a way to create our UserSession object directly from a User
object by just passing it to create.</p>

<p>This lets us write a controller method to do this pretty easily:</p>

<pre><code>def su
  @user = User.find params[:id]
  current_user_session.destroy
  UserSession.create!(@user)
  flash[:notice] = "You've been su-d to that user."
  redirect_to dashboard_path
end
</code></pre>

<p>Add in a route:</p>

<pre><code>map.admin_su "/admin/su/:id", :controller =&gt; "admin", :action =&gt; "su"
</code></pre>

<p>And to a view somewhere in your administrative tools:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= link_to "log in as this user", admin_su_path(@user) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And we&#8217;re good to go!</p>

<p>One last thing about this, though: You don&#8217;t want to let anyone who&#8217;s not an
administrator do this, for obvious reasons. My administrative controllers
always include a block like this:</p>

<pre><code>access_control do
  allow :admin
end
</code></pre>

<p>acl9 makes this really easy, but it&#8217;s really important.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Easy as pie.</p>

<p>EDIT: This post made the Rails subreddit, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/cb0da/writing_a_su_feature_with_authlogic/c0rf26w">brettbender posted his code</a>
to get you back to admin. Here it is:</p>

<blockquote><p>I used this article to help build a su feature for a rails app I&#8217;m working
on. thought I would share the code to let you su / exit-su back to the
original user you were logged in as. You just need to add a link somewhere
persistent if your session contains an entry for :su_user that links to the
unsu action.</p>

<p>Inside your admin controller, make sure you limit access to these actions:</p>

<pre><code>def su
  @user = User.find params[:id]

  # change these 3 lines to apply to your session representation
  session[:su_user] = self.current_user.id
  self.current_user = @user

  flash[:notice] = "You've been logged in as #{@user.login}."
  redirect_to "/"
end

def unsu
  redirect_url = "/"
  if(session.has_key?(:su_user))
    self.current_user = User.find session[:su_user]
    session.delete :su_user
    flash[:notice] = "You have exited your switch user session. You are
    redirect_url = "/admin/users/"
  else
    flash[:error] = "Sorry, we couldn't find your original user."
  end

  redirect_to redirect_url
end
</code></pre></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kanye West posted something interesting about the nature of creativity today.
I&#8217;m going to make a copy of it here, because I find the presentation also
interesting. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kanyewest.com/2010/03/02/creativity">his post</a>, for reference.</p>

<p><img src="/images/kanye.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not the biggest Kanye fan. I go back and forth. But I think that this is
an interesting, personal look into the creative process of someone whose work
is at least widely known and recognized.</p>

<p>Goood quotes from unlikely sources</p>

<p>I agree with charlesju on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1163873">Hacker News</a>, I think this line is my favorite:</p>

<blockquote><p>I never feel like I&#8217;m not the underdog. I never felt completely comfortable.
I&#8217;m tormented by the need to create.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve basically felt that same itch for large parts of my life. Sometimes, I
haven&#8217;t paid it much attention, but that need has been the source of some of
the more interesting things I&#8217;ve done. I talked a little bit about this in my
post last week about <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/appreciating-the-gift-of-creation">the gift of creation</a>. That post was more about
recognizing the surface signs of the creative itch than examining the
underlying motivations that drive the creative process.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8221; is the harder question, of course. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking a
lot about lately. One of the fundamental tenets of capitalism is the
incentivisation of behaviors. Some jobs are paid more simply because we want
to encourage people to do them. Garbage collectors, for instance, get paid
pretty well for the relative level of difficulty their duties entail. Even
though it&#8217;s an unskilled job, nobody wants to do it, so they make well over
minimum wage. Some of the socialist literature I&#8217;ve been examining lately
basically posits that monetary incentives aren&#8217;t the only kind of incentives,
and that even if the monetary incentives no longer existed, people would still
do &#8220;undesirable&#8221; things. I&#8217;m not sure that I buy it on a wide scale, but when
I look at myself, this is absolutely true. Even when I didn&#8217;t pay my rent via
code, I still coded. I wasn&#8217;t as fulfilled as a person, but I managed to
exist, and still create. That&#8217;s what caused that thought to tumble around in
my brain for the last month or two&#8230; why bother creating?</p>

<p>Haters gonna hate</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really amazing that people still continue to create at all, when there&#8217;s
so much criticism out there. <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/03/02/hiatus.html">Al3x</a>, a Twitter engineer, is shutting down
his blog. For now. Part of his reason is related; he&#8217;s writing for himself,
and he feels the responses of others take away more than they contribute:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lately, I’ve found the cathartic returns from blog-format writing to be
diminishing. The ideas I’m trying to express never really get put to rest in
my head when I write, now. Instead, they spark whole conversations that I
never intended to start in the first place, conversations that leech precious
time and energy while contributing precious little back. Negative responses I
can slough off, but the sense that I’m not really crystalizing my unset
thoughts by writing here is what bothers me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I sort of felt the same way when my blog got linked to by Reddit a few weeks
back; there was a lot of bullshit. And it&#8217;s frustrating. My initial
motivations are similar to Al3x&#8217;s; I find that writing helps me to fill out my
thoughts. I&#8217;ve been trying to make writing a habit, and it&#8217;s been hard to find
both the time and topics that are fleshed out enough for me to finish them off
by writing about them. But pushing myself is part of the challenge, and I
expect to get better at it as time goes on. Hopefully, this means that in the
future, I&#8217;ll be able to synthesize more fully thought-through opinions at a
faster rate than before. I&#8217;ll also have examined my own thoughts, opinions,
and convictions more closely, and made sure that they&#8217;re in line with what I
truly believe is right. What I&#8217;m trying to get at is this: creation is always
incredibly personal. An author puts some of himself into every work that he
makes. So criticism against a work is extremely easy to consider as an attack
against the author itself. So it&#8217;s difficult to create and put stuff out
there, only to get it criticized by everyone is frustrating.</p>

<p>And the verdict is&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; I&#8217;m still not sure. This is a topic I&#8217;ll continue to write about, as my
feelings become more clear. There has to be something more fundamental
involved here. I haven&#8217;t found it yet, I just know that I can&#8217;t sit around and
watch TV. I can&#8217;t work a &#8216;normal&#8217; job and toil away on some reporting system
that helps just a few people do their jobs a little bit better. I&#8217;ve gotta do
something more important than that, change the world, keep pushing.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll keep telling you about it. So that I can figure it out for myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bet social psychologists are having a field day with the Internet. I know
nothing about the field, so I don&#8217;t know if there are thousands of papers
about it already written or not, but there should be. I can&#8217;t image that we&#8217;ve
ever had a period in history when more communities are being formed; they&#8217;re
also being formed out in the open.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been involved in many different online communities over the years. I&#8217;ve
already written before about the seeming decline of Reddit&#8217;s content&#8230; but
this past week, something really interesting has happened. Reddit has had two
major events occur that have caused it to be increasingly self-reflexive on
the values and norms that the community desires for itself. This is
particularly interesting because normally, cultural norms have to be observed,
not codified. But here, we&#8217;re seeing completely open discussion about &#8220;The
community says this is not okay.&#8221; It&#8217;s really interesting stuff.</p>

<h2>Speed Issues</h2>

<p>I won&#8217;t comment on the technical details involved, but Reddit has gotten
significantly slower over the past few months. This is normal, as the
community is growing. But it&#8217;s caused quite a bit of a stir lately. Many users
are seeing increased loading times, error messages, missing posts, and various
other problems.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s a user to do in this situation? Post about it. See the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=fix+search&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=month">posts about the
search feature</a>, or posts about the slowdown.</p>

<p>For example, as I look for the links to these posts, I get this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our search machines are under too much load to handle your request right
now. :( Sorry for the inconvenience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Amusing. But unfortunate. The interesting part, though, is the backlash
against the complaints. See this thread, &#8221;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7jnr/reddit_fix_your_fucking_users_they_are_unbearably/">Reddit, fix your fucking users.
They are unbearably bitchy.</a>&#8221; (The cursing is emulating the posts made
complaining about Reddit&#8217;s lack of speed.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a huge discussion about what it means to be part of a free online
community. There&#8217;s a contingent of people who say that people aren&#8217;t entitled
to complain, because Reddit is free. Another points out that complaining is
better than silently leaving the site, and that while people don&#8217;t pay for
Reddit accounts, the eyeballs Reddit users provide enable the site to make
money.</p>

<p>Some choice comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, my incredibly expensive Reddit subscription fees entitle me to 100%
perfect service! LEAVE ME ALONE!</p>

<p>Man, I&#8217;ve been loving this particular strawman for over a decade now. Thanks
for breaking out the classics.</p>

<p>The reality is that Reddit is a business. The owners get paid because the
users keep coming back to the site. Having users bitch and moan is not a
problem for the admins - this isn&#8217;t their personal blog, they&#8217;re not mopy
teenagers who are gonna cut themselves when they see how mean people are being
to them on the interwebs.</p>

<p>The problem for the admins is when users stop visiting Reddit altogether
because of constant technical problems, or fishy administrative decisions
about deleting threads, or too many spammers, or etc. They would much rather
have us bitch about these things on the front page, create giant threads about
them that keep thousands of posters and tens of thousands of readers engaged
and on the site, and provide catharsis and a public forum to address the
issues.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Reddit is a business, they&#8217;d rather have us complain than have us
leave.</p>

<p>Meta-bitching about bitching time</p>

<p>The OP posted a well thought out comment simply suggesting that Reddit&#8217;s
users should be polite and respectful when addressing each other and the
people that make using this site possible, and 90% of the responses here just
prove his point. It seems like people are more concerned with gaining comment
karma by posting bad one-liners than actually participating in intelligent
conversation.</p>

<p>Is anyone else absolutely done with the reddit user base? I mean&#8230; I was
told that reddit was this great intellectual news aggregator that through the
use of &#8216;karma&#8217; was able to bad submissions off the front page.</p>

<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been here all that has been up on the front
page has been Glen Beck, Conan O&#8217;Brian, Tiger Woods, weekly &#8220;Reddit is slow&#8221;
posts and now this Saydrah BS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll say what I said when Conan O&#8217;Brian was on the front page for a week
longer then Haiti ever was: I DON&#8217;T CARE. The Reddit admins don&#8217;t think
Saydrah has abused her power as a moderator. At the very least (I personally
don&#8217;t think she is a spammer) go flame some of the other 1000000000000000
spammers on reddit FFS. This is boring uneducated dribble.</p>

<p>KEEP THIS TRASH OFF THE FRONT PAGE.</p></blockquote>

<p>And more. Interesting stuff, overall. There&#8217;s still quite a few trash
comments, though.</p>

<h2>The Saydrah Situation</h2>

<p>The other event involves a user named Saydrah. She&#8217;s been accused of promoting
links on Reddit for money, and abusing her moderator powers in conjunction
with those offenses. This has spawned a huge amount of discussion on if these
actions were inappropriate or not. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7e25/today_i_learned_that_one_of_reddits_most_active/">the first big thread</a>. Then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7hpb/re_the_alleged_conflict_of_interest_on_reddit/">an
AMA with moderators about their opinions</a>. Lastly, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7tew/fine_here_saydrah_ama_it_couldnt_get_much_worse/">Saydrah does an AMA</a>
herself and explains her side of the story.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t show you a bunch of comments, only one. And it echoes my opinion on
the matter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Two things: Frankly, I don&#8217;t care if people are paid to submit links&#8230;if
they&#8217;re interesting, I upvote. If not, I ignore them.</p>

<p>Second, I have lurked around AR and RA a fair amount, and consistently find
myself thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s a helpful and well-reasoned response! Oh, it&#8217;s
Saydrah again!&#8221; Whatever else people may say, I feel that you at least do try
to contribute positively to this site.</p>

<p>&#8230;I guess I don&#8217;t have a question, so I&#8217;ll just leave my un-asked-for
opinion here.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more, on both sides of the conflict. Regardless, people are
hashing it out.</p>

<h2>Growth Hurts</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re called &#8220;growing pains.&#8221; Change is always a painful
time in any organism&#8217;s life, and even though there&#8217;s a lot of drama, the
current Reddit staff can take pride that they&#8217;ve created something that&#8217;s so
important to people that they feel the need to scream about it for hours. It&#8217;s
unfortunate that their baby is being embroiled in a flamewar, but these things
happen.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see what the community ends up deciding is acceptable. I&#8217;ve managed to
not get involved in these particular conflicts, but it sure is interesting to
watch!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve taken over a project by someone named
_why. He dropped off of the face of the Internet back in March, and the
community has picked up his works. Because I&#8217;ll be writing about the project
in the future, and because I feel these words are still relevant, I&#8217;m
reprinting the two of his essays that led up to the creation of the project,
Hackety Hack, here on my blog. Here&#8217;s the second one.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<h1>The Hackety Manifesto</h1>

<p>Nearly four years ago, I wrote an essay called The Little Coder&#8217;s Predicament.
It&#8217;s not too unusual. Lots of others like it have been written. The point is:
programming just isn&#8217;t available to people like it was with the Commodore 64.
I also outlined my requirements for a new cross-platform programming
environment for beginners.</p>

<p>The essay was widely linked on Slashdot, Reddit, Lambda, etc. I got lots of
mail from people who both agreed and disagreed. Great. Nice. Good people all
of them! And yet, nothing has changed. Not really!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been told of the Xbox development kit and possible programming of Wii
channels. The Playstation actually had a language. But none if it has met my
criteria for a proper coding platform.</p>

<h2>An Aside: We Care, But Not Enough</h2>

<p>So, why has nothing been done about this? Maybe our interpreters and IDEs
(ewww…) are good enough? Lots of people wrote in to say that HTML and
JavaScript are the new BASIC. NO!!! You can&#8217;t be serious!!! So people have to
write two languages now, which are intertwined in an almost inexplicable and
unfathomable way? This doesn&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>Hello world should be one line.</p>

<p>In fact, downloading an MP3 should be one line!!</p>

<p>We just don&#8217;t care right now, do we? Programmers have a paid gig. So business
is happily slurping them up. Look at our books. Look at the programming sites.
Programming is tightly coupled to business. Often the first example is an
e-commerce site! Our books are like FIFTY DOLLARS!! For crying out loud.</p>

<p>This diatribe isn&#8217;t about business being bad. Of course you need to feed your
family and drive an Audi.</p>

<p>This diatribe is about adding some balance to the world of programming. Okay,
so, let&#8217;s take things into our own hands and bring hacking to the young folks.</p>

<h2>The Bylaws of Hackety</h2>

<p>Here are the rules by which Hackety Hack was established:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beginners should be greeted to Hackety Hack by a cartoon character. (For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s call this character: Hacky Mouse.)</li>
<li>Also, helpful sentences. Preferably short and with a period.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack is fundamentally a browser and a programming language. For now, Gecko and Ruby.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m only using Ruby because I know it. Hopefully, more languages can be added!</li>
<li>Again, this isn&#8217;t about Ruby, it&#8217;s about simply offering a place for plainspeople to tinker with code.</li>
<li>IDEs are a disaster. Newbs should see only one non-scary window free of tree controls and pinned windows and toolbars.</li>
<li>As such, we want to stay away from project files and makefiles, the trappings of an IDE.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack also adds simple libraries for common things.</li>
<li>Common things are one-liners.</li>
<li>Keep args and options to a minimum.</li>
<li>In Ruby, blocks should be used to open up a method to more advanced possibilities.</li>
<li>Help files are clean, short, simple. Lots of short examples. No frames.</li>
<li>While all bug tickets are helpful and great, I just value tickets from beginners to a greater degree.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack is free and will remain free henceforth.</li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond that… anything which makes life easy and fun for Hackety Hackers is
definitely encouraged, even demanded.</p>

<h1>The Little Coder&#8217;s Predicament</h1>

<p>Okay, then, children of the modern age (where we live in a world so tied
together with wires that Pangaea ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; nowhere!), you tell me if this is
a predicament or not.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, you could look up from your <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/">Commodore 64</a>, hours after
purchasing it, with a glossy feeling of empowerment, achieved by the pattern
of notes spewing from the speaker grille in an endless loop. You were part of
the movement to help machines sing! You were a programmer! The <a href="http://kl.net/atari/">Atari 800</a>
people had BASIC. They know what I&#8217;m talking about. And the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070612155724/www.guidry.org/ti994a/systempics/4asystem-2.jpg">TI-994A</a> guys
don&#8217;t need to say a word, because the TI could <a href="http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/ti99/ti99_syn.jpg">say it</a> for them!</p>

<p>The old machines don&#8217;t compare to the desktops of today, or to the consoles of
today. But, sadly, current versions of Windows have no immediately accessible
programming languages. And what&#8217;s a kid going to do with Visual Basic? Build a
modal dialog? Forget coding for XBox. Requires registration in the XBox
Developer Program. Otherwise, you gotta crack the sucker open. GameCube?
GameBoy? Playstation 2?</p>

<h2>Coding Just Isn&#8217;t Accessible</h2>

<p>Yes, there are burgeoning <a href="http://openxdk.sourceforge.net/">free</a> <a href="http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/">SDKs</a> for many of these platforms. But
they are obscure and most children have no means of actually deploying or
executing the code on their own hardware! This is obvious to us all and likely
doesn&#8217;t seem such a big deal. But ask yourself what might have happened had
you not had access to a programming language on an Atari 800 or a Commodore.
You tell me if this is a predicament.</p>

<p>It turns out, most of the kids in my neighborhood are exposed to coding
through the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/">TI calculator</a>. A handful of <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/programming/columns/">languages</a> are available on
the TI and its processor is interesting enough to evoke some curiousity. But
this hasn&#8217;t spread to its PDA big brothers, where young people could have more
exposure to programming. And undoubtedly the utility of a language on the
Palm, Pocket PC and others would be useful to many.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the problem here? We have no shortage of new languages, but they
become increasingly distanced from the populace. Are the companies behind
these platforms weary of placing the power of a programming language in the
hands of users? Is there not a demand any longer? It&#8217;s got to be some kind of
greed, power, money thing, right?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is just another reason to push Linux and BSD on consumer systems.
Still, are scripting languages easily accessible to beginners on those
systems? OSX has made several scripting languages available (including Ruby
and Python), but most users are unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>I should mention that Windows is equipped with its own scripting host for
developing in JScript and VBScript. But the use of the scripting host is (I
believe) under-documented and limited for beginners. Try doing something
useful in a script without using Server.CreateObject. Let&#8217;s not let kids touch
the COM objects, please!</p>

<h2>The Christmas List</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking a toy language for consoles and desktops alike could be
monumental. I&#8217;m ot saying it needs to be cross-platform. A language for
GameCube that took advantage of platform-specific features could be more
appealing to GameCube users than a language that used a reduced featureset,
but could execute on a handheld. Really, we live in a world where both choices
should be available.</p>

<p>As for essential features:</p>

<h3>1. Transportable code.</h3>

<p>On my TI-994A, I could make a little, animated Optimus Prime from pixels.
Insert cassette. Record. Pass around to friends. Receive high fives from
friends. Put on wraparound shades. Thank you, TI! Thank you, Optimus Prime!</p>

<p>A little language for the consoles could be wildly popular if combined with
the good ature of sharing code. This could be done by trading memory cards,
but would be more effective if code could be easily obtained and posted on the
Web. Learning would accelerate and collaborative development could take place.</p>

<p>A suitable language should give coders access to I/O devices, to allow
experimentation with network devices and the ability to enhance one&#8217;s
connectivity with others. For the consoles, games could provide hooks for user
mods. This has long proven a successful staple of the desktop gaming world.</p>

<h3>2. Simplicity.</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve got to be able to write a single line of code and see a result. We need
some instant results to give absolute beginners confidence. Simple methods for
sending an e-mail, reading a web page, playing music. Demonstrable in a one-
liner.</p>

<p>Admittedly, as our systems have grown complex, it is difficult to balance
simplicity and capability. Most users will be unimpressed by code that emits
beeps and bloops from a PlayStation 2. If Ruby were available on the PS2, then
I would hope that I could hear rich symphonic sounds from a wee bit of code.</p>

<p><code>Orchestra.play( "A:2", "C:4", "E:1", "G:1" )</code></p>

<p>Access to the graphic engine might require more complex code. But simple
drawing methods could be provided for beginners. Or images could be stored
alongside code and accessed programmatically.</p>

<p><code>ImageLibrary.load( "GolfingOldMan" ).drawAt( 12, 10 )</code></p>

<p>The trick would be to uncover what small applications might entice novices and
still provide the ability to write large applications that would drive
developers to master the language and not limit their growth.</p>

<h3>3. Sensible environment.</h3>

<p>Considering that many won&#8217;t want to purchase a keyboard for their gaming unit,
let&#8217;s make sure that a reasonable environment is provided for entry of text.
Controllers could be worked like the <a href="http://www.handykey.com/">Twiddler</a>. Or code could be
transferred via IR, TCP/IP. (Dare I say cassette? :D)</p>

<h3>4. Give it away!</h3>

<p>It used to be that programming was practically an inalienable right for users.
Include a language with the system, situated in a friendly spot. Each of the
game consoles I&#8217;ve mentioned has launchers. (With the exception of Game Boy
and its successors.) Provide a development prompt from the launcher. From
desktop software, provide shortcuts for both the command prompt and a
development prompt.</p>

<p>Remember, we&#8217;re looking for a language that requires no system hacks. No
obscure links. No warranty violation. We&#8217;ve become so used to these techniques
that it seems to be an essential part of getting our way.</p>

<p>And in many ways it is essential. Tinkering with hardware is learning.
Lobotomizing and renovating is meaningful, magical. On behalf of those who
prefer to code, I make these wishes. Not to take away jobs from the Phillips
screwdriver.</p>

<h2>The Ultimatum</h2>

<p>My challenge is to Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Apple, and to those who
manufacture and develop our interactive technology. Let us interact with these
machines more deeply. Provide us a channel for having a dialogue with the
entertainment boxes we nurture and care for. I swear to you, the relationship
between the public and your product will assuredly blossom. That box will
become more of a chest for our personal works.</p>

<p>In addition, if your developers start putting out crap, then you have a whole
world of people to pick up the slack.</p>

<p>My challenge is for you to bundle a useful programming language with your
product. Ruby, Squeak, REBOL, Python. Take your pick. It will be inexpensive
to add any of these languages to your systems. And people will seriously pray
to you. You know how geeks get when they pledge allegiance to something. But,
yes, Ruby is preferable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A short time ago, the G20 came right here to Pittsburgh. With an event of such
worldwide importance happening in our backyards, several people decided to
document it via social media. The Mattress Factory did a site called &#8220;MyG20&#8221;
and it did pretty well. Some smaller groups did their own thing. But IndyMedia
did one better: <a href="http://indypgh.org/g20/">http://indypgh.org/g20/</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/getting-out-the-anti-globalization-message/">New York Times</a> called it &#8220;One of the best all-purpose sites with
updates from the streets.&#8221; It got quite a lot of attention and hits from all
over. And it was put together by a good friend of mine, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/edfilo">@edfilo</a>. I helped
a teeny tiny bit, but he (with the help of LibSyn) really did an awesome job.</p>

<p>So why should this matter to you? The G20 is old news by now.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s releasing the code for the site, making it available to anyone who wants
to cover events. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Crows,&#8221; and it lives at <a href="http://crowsne.st/">http://crowsne.st/</a>
. With Crows, you can quickly and easily build a site, pulling in content from
Flickr, Twitter, and elsewhere, and posting it all on a geotagged Google Map.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still in its rough infancy, but after the awesome role that it played
during the G20, several other organizations had contacted IndyMedia about
getting access to the code, and so it&#8217;s already gaining traction in the space.
It&#8217;s undergoing rapid development, with new features being added quite fast.
Ed really wants to make this useful for people, and I&#8217;m going to be
contributing to the project in what little spare time I can as well. If you&#8217;re
a coder too, you can <a href="http://github.com/edfilo/crows">fork crows on GitHub</a> to contribute back to the
project.</p>

<p>Check it out, and you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/crowsource">@crowsource</a> on Twitter for updates, too.</p>

<h4>Hi there, I&#8217;m Steve.</h4>

I write both code and prose. Here&#8217;s some of my thoughts about software,
literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
