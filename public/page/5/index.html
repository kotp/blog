  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bet social psychologists are having a field day with the Internet. I know
nothing about the field, so I don&#8217;t know if there are thousands of papers
about it already written or not, but there should be. I can&#8217;t image that we&#8217;ve
ever had a period in history when more communities are being formed; they&#8217;re
also being formed out in the open.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been involved in many different online communities over the years. I&#8217;ve
already written before about the seeming decline of Reddit&#8217;s content&#8230; but
this past week, something really interesting has happened. Reddit has had two
major events occur that have caused it to be increasingly self-reflexive on
the values and norms that the community desires for itself. This is
particularly interesting because normally, cultural norms have to be observed,
not codified. But here, we&#8217;re seeing completely open discussion about &#8220;The
community says this is not okay.&#8221; It&#8217;s really interesting stuff.</p>

<h2>Speed Issues</h2>

<p>I won&#8217;t comment on the technical details involved, but Reddit has gotten
significantly slower over the past few months. This is normal, as the
community is growing. But it&#8217;s caused quite a bit of a stir lately. Many users
are seeing increased loading times, error messages, missing posts, and various
other problems.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s a user to do in this situation? Post about it. See the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=fix+search&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=month">posts about the
search feature</a>, or posts about the slowdown.</p>

<p>For example, as I look for the links to these posts, I get this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our search machines are under too much load to handle your request right
now. :( Sorry for the inconvenience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Amusing. But unfortunate. The interesting part, though, is the backlash
against the complaints. See this thread, &#8221;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7jnr/reddit_fix_your_fucking_users_they_are_unbearably/">Reddit, fix your fucking users.
They are unbearably bitchy.</a>&#8221; (The cursing is emulating the posts made
complaining about Reddit&#8217;s lack of speed.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a huge discussion about what it means to be part of a free online
community. There&#8217;s a contingent of people who say that people aren&#8217;t entitled
to complain, because Reddit is free. Another points out that complaining is
better than silently leaving the site, and that while people don&#8217;t pay for
Reddit accounts, the eyeballs Reddit users provide enable the site to make
money.</p>

<p>Some choice comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, my incredibly expensive Reddit subscription fees entitle me to 100%
perfect service! LEAVE ME ALONE!</p>

<p>Man, I&#8217;ve been loving this particular strawman for over a decade now. Thanks
for breaking out the classics.</p>

<p>The reality is that Reddit is a business. The owners get paid because the
users keep coming back to the site. Having users bitch and moan is not a
problem for the admins - this isn&#8217;t their personal blog, they&#8217;re not mopy
teenagers who are gonna cut themselves when they see how mean people are being
to them on the interwebs.</p>

<p>The problem for the admins is when users stop visiting Reddit altogether
because of constant technical problems, or fishy administrative decisions
about deleting threads, or too many spammers, or etc. They would much rather
have us bitch about these things on the front page, create giant threads about
them that keep thousands of posters and tens of thousands of readers engaged
and on the site, and provide catharsis and a public forum to address the
issues.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Reddit is a business, they&#8217;d rather have us complain than have us
leave.</p>

<p>Meta-bitching about bitching time</p>

<p>The OP posted a well thought out comment simply suggesting that Reddit&#8217;s
users should be polite and respectful when addressing each other and the
people that make using this site possible, and 90% of the responses here just
prove his point. It seems like people are more concerned with gaining comment
karma by posting bad one-liners than actually participating in intelligent
conversation.</p>

<p>Is anyone else absolutely done with the reddit user base? I mean&#8230; I was
told that reddit was this great intellectual news aggregator that through the
use of &#8216;karma&#8217; was able to bad submissions off the front page.</p>

<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been here all that has been up on the front
page has been Glen Beck, Conan O&#8217;Brian, Tiger Woods, weekly &#8220;Reddit is slow&#8221;
posts and now this Saydrah BS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll say what I said when Conan O&#8217;Brian was on the front page for a week
longer then Haiti ever was: I DON&#8217;T CARE. The Reddit admins don&#8217;t think
Saydrah has abused her power as a moderator. At the very least (I personally
don&#8217;t think she is a spammer) go flame some of the other 1000000000000000
spammers on reddit FFS. This is boring uneducated dribble.</p>

<p>KEEP THIS TRASH OFF THE FRONT PAGE.</p></blockquote>

<p>And more. Interesting stuff, overall. There&#8217;s still quite a few trash
comments, though.</p>

<h2>The Saydrah Situation</h2>

<p>The other event involves a user named Saydrah. She&#8217;s been accused of promoting
links on Reddit for money, and abusing her moderator powers in conjunction
with those offenses. This has spawned a huge amount of discussion on if these
actions were inappropriate or not. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7e25/today_i_learned_that_one_of_reddits_most_active/">the first big thread</a>. Then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7hpb/re_the_alleged_conflict_of_interest_on_reddit/">an
AMA with moderators about their opinions</a>. Lastly, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7tew/fine_here_saydrah_ama_it_couldnt_get_much_worse/">Saydrah does an AMA</a>
herself and explains her side of the story.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t show you a bunch of comments, only one. And it echoes my opinion on
the matter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Two things: Frankly, I don&#8217;t care if people are paid to submit links&#8230;if
they&#8217;re interesting, I upvote. If not, I ignore them.</p>

<p>Second, I have lurked around AR and RA a fair amount, and consistently find
myself thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s a helpful and well-reasoned response! Oh, it&#8217;s
Saydrah again!&#8221; Whatever else people may say, I feel that you at least do try
to contribute positively to this site.</p>

<p>&#8230;I guess I don&#8217;t have a question, so I&#8217;ll just leave my un-asked-for
opinion here.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot more, on both sides of the conflict. Regardless, people are
hashing it out.</p>

<h2>Growth Hurts</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re called &#8220;growing pains.&#8221; Change is always a painful
time in any organism&#8217;s life, and even though there&#8217;s a lot of drama, the
current Reddit staff can take pride that they&#8217;ve created something that&#8217;s so
important to people that they feel the need to scream about it for hours. It&#8217;s
unfortunate that their baby is being embroiled in a flamewar, but these things
happen.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see what the community ends up deciding is acceptable. I&#8217;ve managed to
not get involved in these particular conflicts, but it sure is interesting to
watch!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve taken over a project by someone named
_why. He dropped off of the face of the Internet back in March, and the
community has picked up his works. Because I&#8217;ll be writing about the project
in the future, and because I feel these words are still relevant, I&#8217;m
reprinting the two of his essays that led up to the creation of the project,
Hackety Hack, here on my blog. Here&#8217;s the second one.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<h1>The Hackety Manifesto</h1>

<p>Nearly four years ago, I wrote an essay called The Little Coder&#8217;s Predicament.
It&#8217;s not too unusual. Lots of others like it have been written. The point is:
programming just isn&#8217;t available to people like it was with the Commodore 64.
I also outlined my requirements for a new cross-platform programming
environment for beginners.</p>

<p>The essay was widely linked on Slashdot, Reddit, Lambda, etc. I got lots of
mail from people who both agreed and disagreed. Great. Nice. Good people all
of them! And yet, nothing has changed. Not really!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been told of the Xbox development kit and possible programming of Wii
channels. The Playstation actually had a language. But none if it has met my
criteria for a proper coding platform.</p>

<h2>An Aside: We Care, But Not Enough</h2>

<p>So, why has nothing been done about this? Maybe our interpreters and IDEs
(ewww…) are good enough? Lots of people wrote in to say that HTML and
JavaScript are the new BASIC. NO!!! You can&#8217;t be serious!!! So people have to
write two languages now, which are intertwined in an almost inexplicable and
unfathomable way? This doesn&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>Hello world should be one line.</p>

<p>In fact, downloading an MP3 should be one line!!</p>

<p>We just don&#8217;t care right now, do we? Programmers have a paid gig. So business
is happily slurping them up. Look at our books. Look at the programming sites.
Programming is tightly coupled to business. Often the first example is an
e-commerce site! Our books are like FIFTY DOLLARS!! For crying out loud.</p>

<p>This diatribe isn&#8217;t about business being bad. Of course you need to feed your
family and drive an Audi.</p>

<p>This diatribe is about adding some balance to the world of programming. Okay,
so, let&#8217;s take things into our own hands and bring hacking to the young folks.</p>

<h2>The Bylaws of Hackety</h2>

<p>Here are the rules by which Hackety Hack was established:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beginners should be greeted to Hackety Hack by a cartoon character. (For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s call this character: Hacky Mouse.)</li>
<li>Also, helpful sentences. Preferably short and with a period.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack is fundamentally a browser and a programming language. For now, Gecko and Ruby.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m only using Ruby because I know it. Hopefully, more languages can be added!</li>
<li>Again, this isn&#8217;t about Ruby, it&#8217;s about simply offering a place for plainspeople to tinker with code.</li>
<li>IDEs are a disaster. Newbs should see only one non-scary window free of tree controls and pinned windows and toolbars.</li>
<li>As such, we want to stay away from project files and makefiles, the trappings of an IDE.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack also adds simple libraries for common things.</li>
<li>Common things are one-liners.</li>
<li>Keep args and options to a minimum.</li>
<li>In Ruby, blocks should be used to open up a method to more advanced possibilities.</li>
<li>Help files are clean, short, simple. Lots of short examples. No frames.</li>
<li>While all bug tickets are helpful and great, I just value tickets from beginners to a greater degree.</li>
<li>Hackety Hack is free and will remain free henceforth.</li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond that… anything which makes life easy and fun for Hackety Hackers is
definitely encouraged, even demanded.</p>

<h1>The Little Coder&#8217;s Predicament</h1>

<p>Okay, then, children of the modern age (where we live in a world so tied
together with wires that Pangaea ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; nowhere!), you tell me if this is
a predicament or not.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, you could look up from your <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/">Commodore 64</a>, hours after
purchasing it, with a glossy feeling of empowerment, achieved by the pattern
of notes spewing from the speaker grille in an endless loop. You were part of
the movement to help machines sing! You were a programmer! The <a href="http://kl.net/atari/">Atari 800</a>
people had BASIC. They know what I&#8217;m talking about. And the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070612155724/www.guidry.org/ti994a/systempics/4asystem-2.jpg">TI-994A</a> guys
don&#8217;t need to say a word, because the TI could <a href="http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/ti99/ti99_syn.jpg">say it</a> for them!</p>

<p>The old machines don&#8217;t compare to the desktops of today, or to the consoles of
today. But, sadly, current versions of Windows have no immediately accessible
programming languages. And what&#8217;s a kid going to do with Visual Basic? Build a
modal dialog? Forget coding for XBox. Requires registration in the XBox
Developer Program. Otherwise, you gotta crack the sucker open. GameCube?
GameBoy? Playstation 2?</p>

<h2>Coding Just Isn&#8217;t Accessible</h2>

<p>Yes, there are burgeoning <a href="http://openxdk.sourceforge.net/">free</a> <a href="http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/">SDKs</a> for many of these platforms. But
they are obscure and most children have no means of actually deploying or
executing the code on their own hardware! This is obvious to us all and likely
doesn&#8217;t seem such a big deal. But ask yourself what might have happened had
you not had access to a programming language on an Atari 800 or a Commodore.
You tell me if this is a predicament.</p>

<p>It turns out, most of the kids in my neighborhood are exposed to coding
through the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/">TI calculator</a>. A handful of <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/programming/columns/">languages</a> are available on
the TI and its processor is interesting enough to evoke some curiousity. But
this hasn&#8217;t spread to its PDA big brothers, where young people could have more
exposure to programming. And undoubtedly the utility of a language on the
Palm, Pocket PC and others would be useful to many.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the problem here? We have no shortage of new languages, but they
become increasingly distanced from the populace. Are the companies behind
these platforms weary of placing the power of a programming language in the
hands of users? Is there not a demand any longer? It&#8217;s got to be some kind of
greed, power, money thing, right?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is just another reason to push Linux and BSD on consumer systems.
Still, are scripting languages easily accessible to beginners on those
systems? OSX has made several scripting languages available (including Ruby
and Python), but most users are unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>I should mention that Windows is equipped with its own scripting host for
developing in JScript and VBScript. But the use of the scripting host is (I
believe) under-documented and limited for beginners. Try doing something
useful in a script without using Server.CreateObject. Let&#8217;s not let kids touch
the COM objects, please!</p>

<h2>The Christmas List</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking a toy language for consoles and desktops alike could be
monumental. I&#8217;m ot saying it needs to be cross-platform. A language for
GameCube that took advantage of platform-specific features could be more
appealing to GameCube users than a language that used a reduced featureset,
but could execute on a handheld. Really, we live in a world where both choices
should be available.</p>

<p>As for essential features:</p>

<h3>1. Transportable code.</h3>

<p>On my TI-994A, I could make a little, animated Optimus Prime from pixels.
Insert cassette. Record. Pass around to friends. Receive high fives from
friends. Put on wraparound shades. Thank you, TI! Thank you, Optimus Prime!</p>

<p>A little language for the consoles could be wildly popular if combined with
the good ature of sharing code. This could be done by trading memory cards,
but would be more effective if code could be easily obtained and posted on the
Web. Learning would accelerate and collaborative development could take place.</p>

<p>A suitable language should give coders access to I/O devices, to allow
experimentation with network devices and the ability to enhance one&#8217;s
connectivity with others. For the consoles, games could provide hooks for user
mods. This has long proven a successful staple of the desktop gaming world.</p>

<h3>2. Simplicity.</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve got to be able to write a single line of code and see a result. We need
some instant results to give absolute beginners confidence. Simple methods for
sending an e-mail, reading a web page, playing music. Demonstrable in a one-
liner.</p>

<p>Admittedly, as our systems have grown complex, it is difficult to balance
simplicity and capability. Most users will be unimpressed by code that emits
beeps and bloops from a PlayStation 2. If Ruby were available on the PS2, then
I would hope that I could hear rich symphonic sounds from a wee bit of code.</p>

<p><code>Orchestra.play( "A:2", "C:4", "E:1", "G:1" )</code></p>

<p>Access to the graphic engine might require more complex code. But simple
drawing methods could be provided for beginners. Or images could be stored
alongside code and accessed programmatically.</p>

<p><code>ImageLibrary.load( "GolfingOldMan" ).drawAt( 12, 10 )</code></p>

<p>The trick would be to uncover what small applications might entice novices and
still provide the ability to write large applications that would drive
developers to master the language and not limit their growth.</p>

<h3>3. Sensible environment.</h3>

<p>Considering that many won&#8217;t want to purchase a keyboard for their gaming unit,
let&#8217;s make sure that a reasonable environment is provided for entry of text.
Controllers could be worked like the <a href="http://www.handykey.com/">Twiddler</a>. Or code could be
transferred via IR, TCP/IP. (Dare I say cassette? :D)</p>

<h3>4. Give it away!</h3>

<p>It used to be that programming was practically an inalienable right for users.
Include a language with the system, situated in a friendly spot. Each of the
game consoles I&#8217;ve mentioned has launchers. (With the exception of Game Boy
and its successors.) Provide a development prompt from the launcher. From
desktop software, provide shortcuts for both the command prompt and a
development prompt.</p>

<p>Remember, we&#8217;re looking for a language that requires no system hacks. No
obscure links. No warranty violation. We&#8217;ve become so used to these techniques
that it seems to be an essential part of getting our way.</p>

<p>And in many ways it is essential. Tinkering with hardware is learning.
Lobotomizing and renovating is meaningful, magical. On behalf of those who
prefer to code, I make these wishes. Not to take away jobs from the Phillips
screwdriver.</p>

<h2>The Ultimatum</h2>

<p>My challenge is to Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Apple, and to those who
manufacture and develop our interactive technology. Let us interact with these
machines more deeply. Provide us a channel for having a dialogue with the
entertainment boxes we nurture and care for. I swear to you, the relationship
between the public and your product will assuredly blossom. That box will
become more of a chest for our personal works.</p>

<p>In addition, if your developers start putting out crap, then you have a whole
world of people to pick up the slack.</p>

<p>My challenge is for you to bundle a useful programming language with your
product. Ruby, Squeak, REBOL, Python. Take your pick. It will be inexpensive
to add any of these languages to your systems. And people will seriously pray
to you. You know how geeks get when they pledge allegiance to something. But,
yes, Ruby is preferable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A short time ago, the G20 came right here to Pittsburgh. With an event of such
worldwide importance happening in our backyards, several people decided to
document it via social media. The Mattress Factory did a site called &#8220;MyG20&#8221;
and it did pretty well. Some smaller groups did their own thing. But IndyMedia
did one better: <a href="http://indypgh.org/g20/">http://indypgh.org/g20/</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/getting-out-the-anti-globalization-message/">New York Times</a> called it &#8220;One of the best all-purpose sites with
updates from the streets.&#8221; It got quite a lot of attention and hits from all
over. And it was put together by a good friend of mine, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/edfilo">@edfilo</a>. I helped
a teeny tiny bit, but he (with the help of LibSyn) really did an awesome job.</p>

<p>So why should this matter to you? The G20 is old news by now.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s releasing the code for the site, making it available to anyone who wants
to cover events. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Crows,&#8221; and it lives at <a href="http://crowsne.st/">http://crowsne.st/</a>
. With Crows, you can quickly and easily build a site, pulling in content from
Flickr, Twitter, and elsewhere, and posting it all on a geotagged Google Map.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still in its rough infancy, but after the awesome role that it played
during the G20, several other organizations had contacted IndyMedia about
getting access to the code, and so it&#8217;s already gaining traction in the space.
It&#8217;s undergoing rapid development, with new features being added quite fast.
Ed really wants to make this useful for people, and I&#8217;m going to be
contributing to the project in what little spare time I can as well. If you&#8217;re
a coder too, you can <a href="http://github.com/edfilo/crows">fork crows on GitHub</a> to contribute back to the
project.</p>

<p>Check it out, and you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/crowsource">@crowsource</a> on Twitter for updates, too.</p>
