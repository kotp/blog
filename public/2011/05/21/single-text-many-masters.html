<div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone. Here&#8217;s a draft of an essay I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;d love
to hear your feedback.</p>

<p>The word &#8216;engineering&#8217; has a deep connection to the word &#8216;trade-offs&#8217; in
my mind. Most engineering decisions come down to evaluating a few
differing alternatives, and often multiple factors end up being
negatively correlated. You can make something stronger, but then it will
be heavier. It can be made faster, but then it&#8217;s significantly more
expensive. A good engineer is able to take all of these factors into
account, and design a system such that it maximizes its effectiveness
across the sum of all of the relevant constraints. No matter if you consider
the act of writing software an art, science, or engineering, its indisputable
that designing complex software systems is identical in this respect. There are
dozens of different metrics that system architects take into consideration while
crafting a plan of attack, but but there&#8217;s a deeper question of balance
here that&#8217;s significantly different than these more traditional
engineering issues.</p>

<p>Text, in the form of source code, presents unique challenges of
composition. These difficulties all stem from the same root: source code is a
singular text, but must be intelligible to multiple, simultaneous
audiences. More traditional forms of authorship still take audience into
consideration, of course, but the decision to engage a diverse group of
people is the choice of the writer. While mass appeal may be
something that certain authors strive to attain, it&#8217;s not an inherent
property of their chosen form of expression. Source code, while text,
inhabits a multiplicity of forms, and software developers are confronted
with this inherent multi-faceted complexity when composing any
particular software work. Some of these forms suit certain audiences
better than others, and so it falls to the programmer to manage which
form they are currently working in, consider which audience they are
attempting to write for, and arrange all of these forms amongst one
another in such a way that any particular audience is able to navigate
and extract the proper information from the source without confusion.</p>

<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll expand on the concept of audiences for code, and in a
future post, I&#8217;ll explore the simultaneous forms that code takes.</p>

<h2>The multitude of audiences</h2>

<h3>The default audience: the computer</h3>

<blockquote><p>Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art
is everything else we do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don Knuth</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This may seem obvious, but the when considering the question of &#8220;Who are
programs written for?&#8221;, many would say &#8220;The computer. Duh.&#8221; In many
ways, a computer is the primary reader of a particular piece of source
code. The code that&#8217;s given to a computer will be executed billions of
times per second, repeated, recalculated, and re-interpreted over and
over and over again.</p>

<p>The computer&#8217;s native understanding of software comes from machine
code. Machine code are the binary numbers that the CPU loads into memory
and processes directly. For example, here&#8217;s a line of machine code for
an x86 machine that puts the value &#8216;97&#8217; into the AL register, graciously
stolen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembly_language">from
Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<pre><code>10110000 01100001
</code></pre>

<p>While most would consider this unintelligible, computers were actually
programmed this way at one time. My uncle actually did this by flipping
switches to set the binary and pushed a button to store it in memory.
Unfortunately, what&#8217;s good for the computer isn&#8217;t good for the human
programmer. This is why assembly language was created. Assembly language
has a 1 to 1 mapping to machine code, but is much easier for humans to
understand. Here&#8217;s that same line in assembly:</p>

<pre><code>MOV AL, 61h       ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>MOV</code> corresponds with <code>10110</code>, <code>AL</code> maps to <code>000</code>, and 61 hex is
<code>01100001</code>. <code>MOV</code> is short for &#8216;move,&#8217; though, and this mnemonic is just
a bit easier to understand than <code>10110</code>. This is the most basic example
of a compositional trade-off. It&#8217;s not a true trade-off, because they
map perfectly to one another, but it illustrates the difference between
composing in a language that the computer understands and one that&#8217;s
more natural for the programmer. Another important concept comes into
play, that of <em>compilation</em>. Virtually every work of composition created
in software is automatically translated to another form before it is
executed. We&#8217;ll address this concept more fully when we discuss form
later.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s where assembly stopped, it would remain a 1 to 1 mapping.
However, virtually every assembly language also offers macros, and this
moves the code further away from the machine and destroys the
synchrony of the two forms. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, [EBX]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>[]</code> characters change the meaning of <code>EBX</code>, rather than be the
value stored in that particular register, they imply that the value is a
memory address, and we want to move the contents of that address to
<code>EAX</code>. The generated machine code could now be processed into multiple
valid assembly forms, and so the transformation is only perfect in one
direction, even if it&#8217;s possible to &#8216;decompile&#8217; it into one of those
possible encodings. This is considered to be an acceptable trade-off for
human readability; we very rarely want to turn machine code back into
assembly.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a jump between higher level languages, as well. Here&#8217;s the
assembly statements that adds 2 and 3 together:</p>

<pre><code>MOV EAX, 2
ADD EAX, 3
</code></pre>

<p><code>ADD</code>, of course, is the statement that adds a number to the register
that&#8217;s given. Now <code>EAX</code> has the value 5. Here&#8217;s the same code, but in C:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 2;
x = x + 3;
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple. You can see how the C is much easier to understand; we
say what type <code>x</code> is (an integer), and it&#8217;s a bit more explicit. <code>x</code> is
equal to <code>x</code> + three. However, since the C is divorced from the machine,
and is written for the person, we can change our compiler to make
assembly code that works on a different kind of processor architecture.
If we were to compile the above C for x86_64, a 64 bit version of x86,
we might get some assembly that&#8217;d look like this:</p>

<pre><code>MOVL RAX, 2
ADDL RAX, 3
</code></pre>

<p>While this code looks similar to the above, it is quite different. This
uses the native 64 bit types, rather than the 32 bit types above. The
other important thing is that by writing code that&#8217;s divorced from the
machine, and written for people, we&#8217;re able to translate it into the
code for multiple machines. If we had written the assembly above, when
moving to another architecture, it would have required a total re-write.
And while this particular sample looks very similar, a more complex
piece of code will be significantly divergent, but I don&#8217;t want to go
into the details of two kinds of assembly code. Because we can define
the languages for humans, and the language of computers is somewhat
beholden to the physical machine itself, it&#8217;s significantly easier to do
the translation from C to the two kinds of machines, rather than trying
to translate from one machine to another. What we lose in this kind of
translation, though, is efficiency. Code that was hand-crafted for each
machine would be more performant, and better represent each individual
platform.</p>

<p>Even though we may choose to use a language that&#8217;s more understandable
to people, it still has to be understood by the computer in some form.
This translation will introduce some amount of penalty, and so it&#8217;s
important that this gets taken into consideration. Sometimes, code must
be written in a way that&#8217;s not easy for a person to read, because it&#8217;s
easier for the computer to be efficient with a more opaque
implementation.</p>

<h3>The reflexive audience: the programmer himself</h3>

<blockquote><p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brian Kernighan</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone who writes code has experienced this at some time or another.
You write a whole bunch of code, and then a few months goes by, and you
take a look at it, and it&#8217;s absolutely unintelligible. This happens
because at the time of inception, the author of a particular piece of
code has an incredibly close relationship to it. As it was just written,
the code is obvious to the author. They&#8217;re in the proper mindset to
understand the intention that was drawn upon to necessitate bringing
those lines into the world, and so no extra explanation is necessary. As
time goes on, however, the author becomes more close to the third
audience, other programmers. It&#8217;s important for coders to recognize this
fact, and take preventative steps to ameliorate this confusion.</p>

<p>Even though the author will approach the position of the other audience
eventually, this audience is distinct because there is a certain level
of explanation that sits between undocumented, inexpressive code and
code that&#8217;s well explained, and this is the position most code is in. An
explanation that&#8217;s helpful to those who understand the code, but not to
those who don&#8217;t is better than nothing. This sort of code may be overly
contextual, and could use some added information to improve its clarity.</p>

<h3>The other audience: colleagues and coworkers</h3>

<blockquote><p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code is a violent
psychopath who knows where you live.</p>

<ul>
<li>Martin Golding</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As I touched on earlier, there&#8217;s a similarity between the &#8216;other&#8217;
audience and the reflexive. The primary distinction is drawn around the
proximity to the source. The other does not have the advantage of having
authored the code, and therefore doesn&#8217;t have the native&#8217;s understanding
of the underlying logical organization of the source. This disadvantage
can be overcome via composing in such a manner that the meaning is
emergent from the design. Even if it&#8217;s too complex to be obvious, good
documentation can address this particular deficiency.</p>

<p>Ultimately, much of software design is about modeling. Software that
solves a particular problem should emulate the nature of the challenge
it&#8217;s attempting to address. If this can be achieved, it&#8217;s significantly
easier for those who understand the problem to figure out how the
software works. Therefore, good design can help improve the
effectiveness of a given piece of source to communicate its intent.
Along a similar vector, if the design is similar to code that solves a
particular issue, it&#8217;s easier to understand. As an example, a friend
recently asked for feedback about an interface that he&#8217;d designed. It
loaded a save game file for StarCraft 2. This is what he came up with:</p>

<pre><code>replay_file = File.new("spec/fixtures/1v1-game1.sc2replay")
@replay = SC2Refinery::Parser.parse(replay_file)
</code></pre>

<p>However, Ruby already has several kinds of code in its standard library
that loads some information from disk and parses it into some kind of
data structure that you can use in your program. The JSON, YAML, and
Marshall classes already use a set of methods to import and export data,
and they&#8217;re named <code>load</code> and <code>dump</code>, and they&#8217;re part of the class
directly. Also, in this case, the user of the code shouldn&#8217;t need to
deal with the creation of a file, since it&#8217;s unreasonable to assume that
a game replay would come from any other source. Therefore, after some
discussion, he adopted the following interface instead:</p>

<pre><code>@replay = SC2Refinery.load("spec/fixtures/1v1-game1.sc2replay")
</code></pre>

<p>This is much nicer to use, and is much simpler. While it may not seem
like a whole lot, when rules like this are applied across an entire
codebase, they can significantly increase understanding. Multiple
reductions of mental overhead add up quickly.</p>

<p>My new favorite trick for adding a little bit of modeling that
significantly reduces overhead for the user is the Presenter Pattern.
Jeff Casimir demonstrated this very clearly in his presentation at
RailsConf 2011, &#8221;<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69001/Fat%20Models%20Aren%27t%20Enough%20-%20RailsConf.pdf">Fat Models Aren&#8217;t
Enough</a>&#8221;.
Here&#8217;s a slightly modified example. Imagine that we have a system that
manages students, and we&#8217;d like to display a report card for them. We
might start with some code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>student = Student.find(options[:student_id])
term = Term.find(options[:term_id])
report_type = ReportType.find(options[:report_type])

puts "#{student.last_name}, #{student.first_name}"
puts "#{report_type.report_title} for #{term.start_date} to #{term.end_date}"
student.courses.each do |course|
  course_report = student.report_data_for_course(course)
  puts course_report.to_s
end
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, until this past week, this is the exact code that I would have
written. But it turns out that we can do better. Basically, we&#8217;re
displaying some information that comes from a combination of three
different objects. If we think about it some more, we&#8217;re really trying
to display a report card. So let&#8217;s make an object that represents the
card, and delegates to its sub-objects. It will then know how to display
itself.</p>

<pre><code>class ReportCard
  delegate :start_date, :end_date, :to =&gt; :term
  delegate :first_name, :last_name, :courses, :report_data_for_course, :to =&gt; :student
  delegate :report_title, :to =&gt; :report_type

  def initialize(params)
    @student = Student.find params[:student_id]
    @term = Term.find params[:term_id]
    @report_type = ReportType.find params[:report_type_id]
  end

  def student_name
    [last_name, first_name].join(", ")
  end

  def title
    "#{report_title} for #{start_date} to #{end_date}"
  end

  def course_reports
    out = ""
    courses.each do |course|
      out += report_data_for_course(course)
    end
    out
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is a lot of code. However, as you can see, it&#8217;s all focused on
composing the information and exposing an interface that makes sense for
a report card. Using it is super easy:</p>

<pre><code>report = ReportCard.new(options)
puts report.student_name
puts report.title
puts report.course_reports
</code></pre>

<p>Bam! It&#8217;s incredibly obvious. This code is much more clear than before.
We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;m still as hot on this pattern as I am now in a few
months, but I feel the extra object adds a significant amount of
clarity.</p>

<p>If the model is too hard to create, or if additional clarity is needed,
documentation in the form of comments can also help to improve the
understanding of the &#8216;other&#8217; audience. Comments can be a difficult form
of prose to write, because they need to be written at the correct level
of abstraction. If they simply repeat what the code does, they&#8217;re
useless, and if they&#8217;re too high-level, certain details and semantics
may not be made clear.</p>

<p>Individual bits of code can also be made more clear by developing a
narrative within any particular method that&#8217;s being written. Telling a
story with code may not be something you&#8217;ve considered before, but it&#8217;s
really about maintaining a proper flow in the actions your code is
taking. For example, if there&#8217;s a bunch of error handling strewn about
inside of a method, it&#8217;s less clear than bunching all of the error
handling near the end. Most code should be an act in three parts: input,
processing, and output. If these three parts are mixed together, it can
appear much more complicated.</p>

<h3>The forgotten audience: end-users</h3>

<blockquote><p>If I asked my customers what they wanted, they&#8217;d have told me, &#8220;A
faster horse.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Henry Ford</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, all software is used by someone. Use-value is the driving
force of virtually all code. Code that doesn&#8217;t do anything may be making
some kind of important philosophical statement, but isn&#8217;t really the
sort that I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>The introduction of a user imposes significant restrictions upon the way
that code is composed. End-users do not need to understand the code
itself, but they do need to be able to understand its external
interfaces. These needs place an imposition on the way that the code
needs to be written, because it <em>must</em> address this issue of interface.
Sometimes, interface requirements can create a burden on the internal
implementation. Needing to support certain behaviors and forms can
create complexity for an implementor.</p>

<p>Documentation created for end users must be completely different than
that which is created for those inspecting the code itself. Most
end-users will not be literate in the arts of software development, and
so approach the software object in an entirely different way than those
who write code do. Yet, the same semantics must be passed on to them,
but at a higher level. There&#8217;s a strong movement within the community to
start designing software with this kind of end-user documentation in
mind, called <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">README driven development</a>.
There are advantages to thinking on this level when beginning, but a
nice effect of doing it first is that you can ensure it gets done. A
surprising amount of software has poor documentation for its users,
because it&#8217;s created after the software is finished, and at that time
there&#8217;s intense pressure to ship it out the door. Writing down
information for the end user first ensures that it&#8217;s done properly, that
all development works in accordance with the documentation, and that all
of the use-cases for an end-user have been thought of and are being
addressed.</p>
