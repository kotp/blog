<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for this book for a while. &#8220;Rework&#8221; is the new book by Jason
Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson from 37signals. It hit stores on Tuesday.
Here&#8217;s a (non-affiliate) link to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_t1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1RRQJN39HSJ4SMVA2EM4&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Rework on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m down in Houston, Texas. I&#8217;m here for a
few days before heading over to Austin for SXSW. There&#8217;s a lot of really cool
start up stuff, as well as 3D people, and a friend of mine. It&#8217;s been a good
trip so far. But even with waking up at 3am, connecting flights, and a few
hours of driving, I still managed to find a spare moment to head over to a
Borders and grab a copy of Rework. And even though I&#8217;m running all over town,
Nick is driving, so I&#8217;ve been able to read all of Rework in between lunches
and networking events.</p>

<p>Rework is interesting. I described it earlier today <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/10281523422">as a philosophy text</a>,
and I feel that description is absolutely apt. It&#8217;s 37signals in its purest,
most potent form. If you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>, this territory will
be familiar. In fact, a lot of it is basically the same. I&#8217;d be lying if I
told you otherwise. The real truth is that it doesn&#8217;t matter. People who don&#8217;t
already know and love 37signals won&#8217;t have read Getting Real, and so this
stuff will be novel to them. People who do won&#8217;t mind re-reading this
information again, as they&#8217;ve bought into the philosophy. And an update isn&#8217;t
a bad thing, either. What makes Rework interesting is how it&#8217;s different from
Getting Real, not what&#8217;s the same.</p>

<p>I thought it&#8217;d be most interesting to talk about Rework in the context of it&#8217;s
own philosophy. I think there are three points in particular in the book
itself that point out just why this book is so good. The first is an old
37signals standby, the other two are new.</p>

<h3>Build half a product, not a half-assed product</h3>

<p>This got <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">a section devoted to it in Getting Real</a>. Here&#8217;s the core idea:</p>

<blockquote><p>Throw in every decent idea that comes along and you&#8217;ll just wind up with a
half-assed version of your product. What you really want to do is build half a
product that kicks ass.</p></blockquote>

<p>They mention that Rework used to be twice as big. The next to last draft was
57,000 words, and the final draft was 27,000. This is the biggest difference
between the two books. It&#8217;s the most pure dosage of Kool-Aid I&#8217;ve ever read.
Each section feels finely honed. They&#8217;re all either one, two, or three pages,
and an accompanying picture. This book is about what&#8217;s worked for the company
so far over its lifetime, and this refinement process is clearly demonstrated
here.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always easy to ask for more. I&#8217;m really curious about the things that
were cut. Were there more sections? Was each section twice as long? A little
of both? At the same time, this exactly exemplifies the thinking this section
is railing against. If the book was twice as long, would I have learned twice
as much? Probably not. YAGNI.</p>

<h3>Decommoditize your product</h3>

<blockquote><p>Make you part of your product or service. Inject what&#8217;s unique about the way
you think into what you sell.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is something that these guys do really well. It&#8217;s part of having such
strong opinions, and sharing them with the world. Everyone knows who 37signals
is and what they stand for. If I wrote each chapter of Rework into a blog
post, you&#8217;d still recognize it as their philosophy. It also comes through in
the writing. They mention in the notes that Matthew Linderman helped them pull
their distinct styles of writing into a more cohesive whole. He did a good
job, and didn&#8217;t let the voice get lost in the editing.</p>

<h3>Out-teach your competition</h3>

<blockquote><p>Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that big
companies can&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

<p>Teaching is a topic I&#8217;ve been getting more and more into lately. Hackety Hack
is about teaching; when I speak, I&#8217;m teaching; this blog is about teaching.
Rework is about teaching the lessons 37signals have learned about business to
the world. A lot of Signal vs. Noise is about teaching. It&#8217;s a great way to
get people to recognize you, and a great way to give back. The world can
always use more great teachers.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason I&#8217;m up late, writing this review. I couldn&#8217;t put Rework down.
I enjoyed revisiting the old topics; the new ones are still tumbling around in
my brain. I&#8217;m sure this book is going to spawn a bunch of posts on this blog
in the future, as I add my own thoughts to the stuff I&#8217;ve learned.
I&#8217;d recommend this book to anyone who&#8217;s working in the business world or doing
a startup, even if they hate that term. It&#8217;ll give you a lot of interesting
thoughts to chew on.</p>

<h4>Hi there, I'm Steve.</h4>

I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
