        <p>Ruby 1.9.3 is coming out soon! <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/2011/05/09/ruby-1-9-3-documentation-challenge">drbrain has challenged the Ruby community to
improve its documentation</a>, but some people were asking about how to do so.
So I made a video!</p>

<p>Some small errata: drbrain has informed me that he should edit the Changelog,
not me. So don't do that. :)</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/23522731">How to contribute to Ruby's documentation.</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>


<p>If you don't want to watch me talk about it, here's the same info, in text:</p>

<p>Getting the Ruby source is pretty easy. You can find it on GitHub, here:
<a href="http://github.com/ruby/ruby">http://github.com/ruby/ruby</a> . Click the "fork" button and clone down your
own fork:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/ruby.git
</code></pre>

<p>After that's done, type <code>cd ruby</code> and add the main project as an upstream. This will
let you keep up-to-date with the latest changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ruby/ruby.git

$ git fetch upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Okay! Now that you're all set up, poke around and find something that needs
documented. I like to just look through the source, but you can also look
<a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/documentation_coverage.txt">here</a> for a list of things that have no docs. Documentation is written in
rdoc, and I'd check the recent commits that drbrain has been making to guide
you in style. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/071a678a156dde974d8e470b659c89cb02b07b3b">This commit</a>, for example, is a pretty good template. You
can also check out the formatting guides <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Markup.html">here</a>. There's also <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/Ruby.html">this</a>
which explains some directives for .rb files and <a href="http://rdoc.rubyforge.org/RDoc/Parser/C.html">this</a> which handles
directives for .c files.</p>

<p>Now that you've made a change to the documentation, you can regenerate the
docs by using rdoc. First, grab the latest version from rubygems:</p>

<p>   $ gem install rdoc</p>

<p>Always best to have the latest tools. Now do this to generate the docs:</p>

<pre><code>$ rdoc --o tmpdoc lib/rss*
</code></pre>

<p>I'm passing it in an output directory with op, since the doc directory is not
an rdoc directory. rdoc will complain and refuse to overwrite those files,
which is a good thing. I'm also passing in a pattern of what to compile
documentation for, compiling all of it takes a few minutes! In this case, I
chose to document the rss library.</p>

<p>Now you have a website in rdocout. Open up its index.html, and poke around for
what you've changed. If it all looks good, you're ready to make a patch!</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -r rdocout

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "adding documentation for $SOMETHING"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have two options here. One is to simply push the change up to GitHub,
and make a pull request.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin
</code></pre>

<p>... aaand pull request. The core Ruby development doesn't really happen on
GitHub though, and so your patch may take a while to get included. If you
really want to do it right, submit a patch to RedMine. We'll use git to make
this patch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git format-patch HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>This says "make a patch out of the last commit." It'll tell you a file name,
it should start with 000.</p>

<p>Now, sign up for the Ruby RedMine <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/account/register">here</a>. Once you've clicked the
confirmation email, <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-19/issues/new">open a new ticket</a>, and assign it to Eric Hodel,
category DOC, and give it your Ruby version, even though it's not a big deal
here. Click 'choose file' and pick your patch, then 'create and continue' and
BAM! You're done!</p>

<p>Let's all pitch in and make this the best documented Ruby release ever! In
writing documentation, you might even find some things that you'd like to help
improve. ;)</p>

            I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
            literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
