        <h1>The next iteration of my blog</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Well well well, some things never change. Long ago, I hosted my own
blog, and here we are again. I've moved everything over to Jekyll, if
that means anything to you. You can now <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/blog">look at my blog on
GitHub</a>. Big thanks to <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/2009/12/29/jekyll-on-heroku.html">this
article</a> for
lots of help and pointers with final deployment stuff, and <a href="http://mikeferrier.ca/2011/04/29/blogging-with-jekyll-haml-sass-and-jammit/">this one</a> for haml and sass and stuff. Yay!</p>

<h2>New-ish beginnings</h2>

<p>So why'd I do this? Well, this is just part of moving more towards
hosting all of my own services, and not relying on services that others
provide. This isn't some sort of argument over individualism vs.
collectivism, it's more about <a href="http://nomoresharecropping.org/">No More Sharecropping</a>.</p>

<p>I'm still relying on people for hosting, of course. Nobody is 100%
removed, but with my own backup of everything, I'm in total control
here. It's really minimal work to keep this going, and only a few hours
of setup to move everything over.</p>

<h2>A small change in focus, too</h2>

<p>I'm also going to stop bitching about politics so often, and try to be
more constructive in general. I have a lot to say about this new
humanities angle that my life has taken as of late. Hence, I've changed
the title of my blog. And you can expect more posts along those lines.
More about books, more about art and code, less whining. One may think
I'm maturing or something...</p>

          positive or negative. I always revise posts with the interesting parts
          of these discussions. Thanks!</p>

          <p>
            I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
            literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
