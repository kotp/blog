        <h1>I'm Making It Dead Simple To Contribute To Ruby's Documentation</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Okay! So, if you'd read <a href="/2011/05/10/contributing-to-ruby-s-documentation.html">my previous article on
this</a>, you'd know how
easy it is to contribute to Ruby's Documentaiton.</p>

<blockquote><p>But Steve, I'm <em>still</em> kinda scared.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay, so here we go: I'm making it even easier on you.</p>

<p>Send me what you want changed, and how, and I'll make a patch and submit
it on your behalf.</p>

<p>No, seriously, I will. I already did once. <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/38873">This guy</a> posted something about how it was too hard, <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/38875">so
I made a patch for him</a>. And now Ruby is better because of it.</p>

<h2>Patches don't have to be patches</h2>

<p>Seriously, I don't even mean diff outputs. I just got this email:</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm eager to contribute docs but I don't know where to start: I don't
mean pulling down the repo and all that, I mean, I see this link
here:http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/documentation_coverage.txt but
all I see is a ton of "# is documented" comments. Where does a
relative n00b begin? Poking around in the source code is, well,
intimidating. I'm completely new to this but I take direction well.
Just point me in the right direction. Just give me something to
document, please!</p></blockquote>

<p>I sent this back:</p>

<blockquote><p>No code diving needed! That's part of it. Let's do this: Find the documentation for one of your favorite methods. Here, I'll pick one: http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M000278 okay, that looks okay, but look at compact!:</p>

<blockquote><p>Removes nil elements from the array. Returns nil if no changes were made, otherwise returns </i>ary</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why's that </i> there? Total screw-up.  For example. So, send me this email:</p>

<p>"Hey Steve-</p>

<p>Check out the docs for Array#compact!, here: http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M000279 . There's an extra </i> that's screwing things up.</p>

<p>-Jonathan"</p>

<p>Done! I'll go from there. How about this one:</p>

<p>"Hey Steve-</p>

<p>I checked out the docs for Time._load, here: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Time.html#M000394</p>

<p>These docs kind of suck. What if I don't know what Marshal is? There should at <em>least</em> be a link to Marshall, here: http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Marshal.html And it should probably say something like "You can get a dumped Time object by using _dump: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Time.html#M000393</p>

<ul>
<li>Jonathan"</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm sure you can find something that's formatted wrong, or worded incorrectly, or anything else.</p>

<p>-Steve</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, the <em>closer</em> it is to an actual patch, the faster I'll be able to
do it. A vague "this documentation is confusing, but I'm not sure why"
is helpful, but will take longer. I'd rather get that email than not. If
you're not sure, hit send.</p>

<h2>Just Do It</h2>

<p>And so I'll do it again. Scared to deal with doc patches? I'll make them
up. I'm serious. I'll do it. Send them to me.</p>

<p>That's all.</p>

<p>Send me patches.
<a href="mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com">steve@steveklabnik.com</a>. Do it.</p>

            I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
            literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
