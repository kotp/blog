      I&#39;ve heard <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Mendicant University</a> (also known as RMU, not to confuse you Robert Morris alums!) described as &quot;the best kept secret of the Ruby community.&quot; High praise, indeed. If you haven&#39;t heard about RMU before, check out this presentation by Andrew Cox: <p /><div><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19576831?portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="283" width="500"></iframe></div><p /><div>TL;DR: RMU is a free, online &#39;unversity&#39; from Gregory Brown, author of &#39;Ruby Best Practices.&#39; You enter an intermediate Rubyist, and you exit an expert. </div> <p /><div>Anyway, RMU recently announced that <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/changelog/visiting-teacher-2011-t2-steve-klabnik" target="_blank">I&#39;ll be their first visiting teacher</a>. Basically, I&#39;ll be hanging out, giving advice, and just generally being even more accessible to RMU students than I already am. Greg and I have talked a lot about education, Ruby, and a lot of other things... between Hackety&#39;s &#39;nothing to intermediate&#39; and RMU&#39;s &#39;intermediate to expert&#39; approaches to learning, anyone wanting to get up to speed with Ruby should have no shortage of resources at their disposal.</div> <p /><div>If you&#39;re feeling like you&#39;ve got the hang of Ruby, but want to take it to the next level, <a href="http://university.rubymendicant.com/admissions" target="_blank">applications are open</a>! Hopefully I&#39;ll see you there.</div>
