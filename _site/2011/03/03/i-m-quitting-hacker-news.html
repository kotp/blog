        <h1>I'm quitting Hacker News</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>I've been thinking about this post for a while.</p>

<p>I freaking love Hacker News. It's my favorite place on the Internet. It's
incredibly valuable. I have learned so much from my time there.  With that
said, I feel like it's taken up too much of my time.</p>

<p>I'm trying to accomplish things. I got accepted to grad school. I'm trying to
rebuild Shoes. I'm working on improving Hackety. I'm finding that I don't have
enough hours in the day to accomplish the things I want to accomplish. And
arguing for the hundredth time about how artists will survive in a post-IP
world, or how to get your first couple of users, or whatever it is that Google
or Apple did this week hasn't gotten boring yet, and that's a problem.</p>

<p>The only respectable solution is to go cold-turkey for a while.</p>

<p>I've been doing good on some of my new years' resolutions, and bad on others.
I haven't spent a lot of time writing lately, and I have only been doing okay
at my writing. Hacker News is cutting into that. I feel like I'm using it in
the same way some use TV. Yeah, it's significantly deeper, but I really should
be reading more books and less HN. At least, that's what's right for me right
now.</p>

<p>I won't be gone forever. I just need to spend more time elsewhere.</p>

<p>With that said, I've been spending a <em>lot</em> of time on Shoes. I'll just leave
this here: <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify">https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify</a></p>

            I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
            literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
