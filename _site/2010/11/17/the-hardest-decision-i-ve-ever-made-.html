      <p>I'll cut to the chase: I've stepped down as CTO of CloudFab. I don't <br />want to discuss details, but life is too short to not be doing what <br />you want with it. And, after a period of careful thought and <br />consideration, it's no longer the right thing for me. It was an <br />amicable parting, and my replacements are already in place, and doing <br />cool things. I'm happy with what I've accomplished, but it's time &nbsp;for me to <br />move on. <p /> This raises the question: what am I moving on to? Here's the answer: <br />Hackety Hack. What I truly care about is teaching, writing, and <br />discussing software. If I could do anything, I'd hack on Hackety, <br />share what I know with others, and keep learning and playing with new <br />things all day long. <p /> However, there's a certain question of sustainability here: I'm not <br />made of money, and I have lots of bills to pay. However, doing the <br />'obvious' thing would be really, truly wrong: Hackety Hack is not and <br />will never be a startup. It's a social venture, if anything: it would <br />be absolutely unquestioningly wrong for me to ever ask anyone for a <br />single cent for it. It'd also be counterproductive: how could I share <br />programming with everyone if I excluded those without disposable <br />income? <p /> So to this end, Hackety cannot be all that I do. And while I really <br />want to teach, I also have a lot to learn. Luckily, I have some great <br />allies in this area: I've been working alongside two teachers at the <br />University of Pittsburgh over the past month or so: one in the English <br />department, and one in the Computer Science department. In doing so, <br />I've come to realize that my place in life is actually in the middle: <br />while I love the theoretical side of CS, I'm actually much more <br />interested in the application. And teachers need to be effective <br />communicators, so investing in writing is absolutely worthwhile for <br />me. At the same time, I've really enjoyed every chance I've had to <br />write: there's a reason I keep three blogs now! I'm also incredibly <br />interested in the parallels that exist between computer and human <br />languages. I like the comparison between refactoring and composition. <br />I think the two fields have a lot to learn from one another. It's <br />something I'd like to explore more. <p /> To do so, I'll have to finish off my undergrad degree. Luckily, I'm <br />very close, so I'll be doing that in the spring. Afterward, it's my <br />intention to go to grad school in the English department, so I'm <br />furiously working on my application, with the help of the <br />aforementioned teacher. At the same time, I'll possibly help teach or <br />TA classes in the CS department as well. I'm hoping to combine my <br />solid foundations in the hard sciences with the new perspective and <br />improved analysis that the humanities can offer. <p /> I don't think that academia is where I want to stay forever, but I <br />think it's a good place for me to grow for now. It's time for me to <br />invest in myself a little. I think I'll end up a much better person in <br />the end.</p>
