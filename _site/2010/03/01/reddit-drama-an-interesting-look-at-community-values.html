      <h1>Reddit drama: an interesting look at community values</h1>
      <p>I bet social psychologists are having a field day with the Internet. I know
nothing about the field, so I don't know if there are thousands of papers
about it already written or not, but there should be. I can't image that we've
ever had a period in history when more communities are being formed; they're
also being formed out in the open.</p>

<p>I've been involved in many different online communities over the years. I've
already written before about the seeming decline of Reddit's content... but
this past week, something really interesting has happened. Reddit has had two
major events occur that have caused it to be increasingly self-reflexive on
the values and norms that the community desires for itself. This is
particularly interesting because normally, cultural norms have to be observed,
not codified. But here, we're seeing completely open discussion about "The
community says this is not okay." It's really interesting stuff.</p>

<h2>Speed Issues</h2>

<p>I won't comment on the technical details involved, but Reddit has gotten
significantly slower over the past few months. This is normal, as the
community is growing. But it's caused quite a bit of a stir lately. Many users
are seeing increased loading times, error messages, missing posts, and various
other problems.</p>

<p>What's a user to do in this situation? Post about it. See the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=fix+search&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=month">posts about the
search feature</a>, or posts about the slowdown.</p>

<p>For example, as I look for the links to these posts, I get this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our search machines are under too much load to handle your request right
now. :( Sorry for the inconvenience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Amusing. But unfortunate. The interesting part, though, is the backlash
against the complaints. See this thread, "<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7jnr/reddit_fix_your_fucking_users_they_are_unbearably/">Reddit, fix your fucking users.
They are unbearably bitchy.</a>" (The cursing is emulating the posts made
complaining about Reddit's lack of speed.)</p>

<p>There's a huge discussion about what it means to be part of a free online
community. There's a contingent of people who say that people aren't entitled
to complain, because Reddit is free. Another points out that complaining is
better than silently leaving the site, and that while people don't pay for
Reddit accounts, the eyeballs Reddit users provide enable the site to make
money.</p>

<p>Some choice comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, my incredibly expensive Reddit subscription fees entitle me to 100%
perfect service! LEAVE ME ALONE!</p>

<p>Man, I've been loving this particular strawman for over a decade now. Thanks
for breaking out the classics.</p>

<p>The reality is that Reddit is a business. The owners get paid because the
users keep coming back to the site. Having users bitch and moan is not a
problem for the admins - this isn't their personal blog, they're not mopy
teenagers who are gonna cut themselves when they see how mean people are being
to them on the interwebs.</p>

<p>The problem for the admins is when users stop visiting Reddit altogether
because of constant technical problems, or fishy administrative decisions
about deleting threads, or too many spammers, or etc. They would much rather
have us bitch about these things on the front page, create giant threads about
them that keep thousands of posters and tens of thousands of readers engaged
and on the site, and provide catharsis and a public forum to address the
issues.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Reddit is a business, they'd rather have us complain than have us
leave.</p>

<p>Meta-bitching about bitching time</p>

<p>The OP posted a well thought out comment simply suggesting that Reddit's
users should be polite and respectful when addressing each other and the
people that make using this site possible, and 90% of the responses here just
prove his point. It seems like people are more concerned with gaining comment
karma by posting bad one-liners than actually participating in intelligent
conversation.</p>

<p>Is anyone else absolutely done with the reddit user base? I mean... I was
told that reddit was this great intellectual news aggregator that through the
use of 'karma' was able to bad submissions off the front page.</p>

<p>Over the past few months I've been here all that has been up on the front
page has been Glen Beck, Conan O'Brian, Tiger Woods, weekly "Reddit is slow"
posts and now this Saydrah BS.</p>

<p>I'll say what I said when Conan O'Brian was on the front page for a week
longer then Haiti ever was: I DON'T CARE. The Reddit admins don't think
Saydrah has abused her power as a moderator. At the very least (I personally
don't think she is a spammer) go flame some of the other 1000000000000000
spammers on reddit FFS. This is boring uneducated dribble.</p>

<p>KEEP THIS TRASH OFF THE FRONT PAGE.</p></blockquote>

<p>And more. Interesting stuff, overall. There's still quite a few trash
comments, though.</p>

<h2>The Saydrah Situation</h2>

<p>The other event involves a user named Saydrah. She's been accused of promoting
links on Reddit for money, and abusing her moderator powers in conjunction
with those offenses. This has spawned a huge amount of discussion on if these
actions were inappropriate or not. Here's <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7e25/today_i_learned_that_one_of_reddits_most_active/">the first big thread</a>. Then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7hpb/re_the_alleged_conflict_of_interest_on_reddit/">an
AMA with moderators about their opinions</a>. Lastly, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7tew/fine_here_saydrah_ama_it_couldnt_get_much_worse/">Saydrah does an AMA</a>
herself and explains her side of the story.</p>

<p>I won't show you a bunch of comments, only one. And it echoes my opinion on
the matter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Two things: Frankly, I don't care if people are paid to submit links...if
they're interesting, I upvote. If not, I ignore them.</p>

<p>Second, I have lurked around AR and RA a fair amount, and consistently find
myself thinking, "That's a helpful and well-reasoned response! Oh, it's
Saydrah again!" Whatever else people may say, I feel that you at least do try
to contribute positively to this site.</p>

<p>...I guess I don't have a question, so I'll just leave my un-asked-for
opinion here.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's a lot more, on both sides of the conflict. Regardless, people are
hashing it out.</p>

<h2>Growth Hurts</h2>

<p>There's a reason they're called "growing pains." Change is always a painful
time in any organism's life, and even though there's a lot of drama, the
current Reddit staff can take pride that they've created something that's so
important to people that they feel the need to scream about it for hours. It's
unfortunate that their baby is being embroiled in a flamewar, but these things
happen.</p>

<p>We'll see what the community ends up deciding is acceptable. I've managed to
not get involved in these particular conflicts, but it sure is interesting to
watch!</p>
