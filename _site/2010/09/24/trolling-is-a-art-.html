      I find it incredibly hard not to be judgmental. <p /> I'm not sure what part of my personality makes this happen, but even <br />when I try to curb tearing down other people, I end up doing it <br />anyway. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I think part of the problem <br />is that these kinds of things are rewarded. <p /> <img src="/images/stevesajerk.png" style="width:450px" /><p /> This is me, being a jerk. <p /> One of the reasons that I use my real name everywhere is to try to <br />improve the civility of my discourse. When you're anonymous, it's <br />really easy to be callous. And when I used a handle, I was even worse. <br />But even now, I can think of three times when I accidentally was mean <br />for basically no reason: That tweet, the Diaspora incident, and the <br />only Hacker News comment I've ever deleted. <p /> In all three of these instances, it's not so much that I was wrong. <br />It's that I ended up presenting my criticisms poorly. I think I did a <br />decent job with the Diaspora one, but people still took it the wrong <br />way, so I failed to communicate. I'm certainly not infallible. I <br />guarantee you there are n00b errors and security holes in my own <br />codebases. So I really shouldn't be so quick to judge. <p /> That's all I have to say about that. I'll just have to do better going forward.
