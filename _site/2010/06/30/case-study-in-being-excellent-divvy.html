      <h1>Case Study in being excellent: Divvy</h1>
      <p>The other day I wrote a post about <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/being-excellent-to-each-other">being excellent to each other</a>.
Today, I've got a great example of that for you: Divvy.</p>

<p>What would you do if you received an email like this?</p>

<p>Here's what happened:</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ckcbr/mizage_a_small_development_company_that_made/">link to the thread</a>. Check out some of these comments:</p>

<p>If you'd also like to support a company for being awesome, here's a link
to <a href="http://www.mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT: They've posted the sales afterward on Reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cmmfg/hey_reddit_a_week_ago_someone_posted_about_divvy/">here</a>.</p>
