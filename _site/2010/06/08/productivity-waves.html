        <h1>Productivity Waves</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Right now, I'm having a bit of a 'darkness before the dawn' kind of moment. I
feel like I might soon start to become productive again.</p>

<p>It's sort of strange, how these things travel in waves. Just a month or two
ago, I was super-ultra-crazy productive. I was working on Hackety, coding
Bindlr, writing three days a week on the blog, and more. This doesn't even
count the more-than-a-full-time CloudFab. But lately, all I've wanted to do
was hang out and play video games.</p>

<p>It seems like this is a cyclic kind of thing. I think 80 hour weeks, even of
things that you love, is kind of unsustainable. It was lots of fun, and I was
feeling pretty good while I was doing it, but now that I'm off that horse,
it's really hard to get back on.</p>

<p>In any case, here's the status of some of the stuff I've been up to, if you've
been wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blog: I've got a bunch of stuff half-written. I'll be starting to finish those
off and getting them up here. I've had lots to say, just no motivation to say it.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch.steve: I want a better design, so I'm not doing anything with the site
'till that's done. I don't want to mess with Ryan's look and feel. But I've got
episodes written up, they just need to be recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Hackety Hack: Fela is making great progress, and I'm going to start reaching
out to Mac development communities to see if I can get some help on the issue
that's ruining my ability to fix things.</p></li>
<li><p>Bindlr: Up, running, and working. Needs more marketing/outreach.</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter: started using it again, you read that post.</p></li>
<li><p>Selling my stuff: most of it is in boxes or thrown away. Time to start selling
the things that were worth money.</p></li>
<li><p>Maria: currently missing her.</p></li>
<li><p>Friends: started actually making it back to XOmB meetings on Saturdays, and
actually going out with some people I haven't talked to in a while. I was really
really bad at this in some cases.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This post is kind of random, and I apologize. I've got a good mix of technical
things, book reviews, and social commentary waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>I'm excited for what June will bring.</p>

            I write both code and prose. Here's some of my thoughts about software,
            literature, art and code, with some politics thrown in on occasion.
