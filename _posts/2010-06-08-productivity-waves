title: Productivity Waves

Right now, I&#39;m having a bit of a &#39;darkness before the dawn&#39; kind of moment. I feel like I might soon start to become productive again.<p /><div>It&#39;s sort of strange, how these things travel in waves. Just a month or two ago, I was super-ultra-crazy productive. I was working on Hackety, coding Bindlr, writing three days a week on the blog, and more. This doesn&#39;t even count the more-than-a-full-time CloudFab. But lately, all I&#39;ve wanted to do was hang out and play video games.</div> <p /><div>It seems like this is a cyclic kind of thing. I think 80 hour weeks, even of things that you love, is kind of unsustainable. It was lots of fun, and I was feeling pretty good while I was doing it, but now that I&#39;m off that horse, it&#39;s really hard to get back on.</div> <p /><div>In any case, here&#39;s the status of some of the stuff I&#39;ve been up to, if you&#39;ve been wondering:</div><p /><div>- Blog: I&#39;ve got a bunch of stuff half-written. I&#39;ll be starting to finish those off and getting them up here. I&#39;ve had lots to say, just no motivation to say it.</div> <div>- Watch.steve: I want a better design, so I&#39;m not doing anything with the site &#39;till that&#39;s done. I don&#39;t want to mess with Ryan&#39;s look and feel. But I&#39;ve got episodes written up, they just need to be recorded.</div> <div>- Hackety Hack: Fela is making great progress, and I&#39;m going to start reaching out to Mac development communities to see if I can get some help on the issue that&#39;s ruining my ability to fix things.</div><div> - Bindlr: Up, running, and working. Needs more marketing/outreach.</div><div>- Twitter: started using it again, you read that post.</div><div>- Selling my stuff: most of it is in boxes or thrown away. Time to start selling the things that were worth money.</div> <div>- Maria: currently missing her.</div><div>- Friends: started actually making it back to XOmB meetings on Saturdays, and actually going out with some people I haven&#39;t talked to in a while. I was really really bad at this in some cases.</div> <p /><div>This post is kind of random, and I apologize. I&#39;ve got a good mix of technical things, book reviews, and social commentary waiting in the wings.</div><p /><div>I&#39;m excited for what June will bring.</div>
