Whew.<p /><div>If you&#39;ve been <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">following me on Twitter</a> at all lately, you&#39;ll know that I&#39;ve been working hard on a new project lately. Tonight, even though it&#39;s late, I&#39;m finally getting it out there. Please welcome <a href="http://rstat.us/">http://rstat.us/</a> to the world! (as soon as the DNS updates. ;) )</div> <p /><div><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is a micro-blogging service, just like Twitter. There&#39;s one big difference, though: it is distributed. Oh, and it&#39;s 100% open source. So two things. It&#39;s also integrated with Facebook and Twitter, so you can just log in with either of those accounts, and it&#39;ll syndicate your posts. Well, just to Twitter right now, but we&#39;re getting there.</div> <p /><div>Here&#39;s the other cool thing: Want to own your data? You can actually <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us">get the code</a> and run a copy yourself! But you won&#39;t get left out: you can follow anyone else that uses the <a href="http://ostatus.org/">ostatus</a> protocol, like <a href="http://identi.ca/">http://identi.ca/</a>, and it&#39;ll Just Work. You just have to grab the URL to their feed, put it in, and it&#39;s all good! But you probably shouldn&#39;t do that yet. We&#39;re still working on some features.</div> <p /><div><a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a> is still very much alpha quality. 7 or 8 of my best friends and I have been fighting off sleep, food, and tests for the last two weeks to put this together. Please <a href="http://rstat.us/">give it a try</a> and let me know what you think, tell me if you can break it, or anything else that&#39;s particularly interesting. If you&#39;re the coding type, please check out the <a href="http://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us/wiki">wiki</a> for a big old list of stuff we&#39;d like to do.</div> <p /><div>Oh, and of course, you should <a href="http://rstat.us/users/steveklabnik">follow me on rstat.us</a>.</div>
