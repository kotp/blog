It's been a long journey. I have a lot to say about this, but it'll have to
wait until I'm not in the middle of nowhere spending some time with Maria's
family. I just wanted to tell you all Merry Christmas, and point you at the
[Hackety Hack v1.0 release announcement][1] and the new
[Hackety Hack website][2].

Merry Christmas!
