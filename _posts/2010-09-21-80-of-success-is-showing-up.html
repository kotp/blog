It&#39;s funny how true this quote is.<p /><div>There are three people that I really admire: _why, Zed Shaw, and Yehuda Katz. And to simplify my tenses a bit, I&#39;ll speak of _why in the present tense. What do these three guys have in common? They all churn out badass software like nobody&#39;s business. _why started so many projects that it just adds to his mythical qualities; Zed has been cranking out software and blogs left and right, and Yehuda&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/09/14/heres-to-the-next-3-years/">I&#39;m quitting Engine Yard</a>&quot; post basically said &quot;I&#39;m pretty much done rebuilding the server side of software in my own image, now it&#39;s time for me to focus on the client side of the equation.&quot; Not with that much hubris, of course, but it&#39;s pretty much true.</div> <p /><div>Now, I don&#39;t mean to imply that they&#39;ve &#39;just shown up,&#39; but it seems to me that productivity is directly related to just getting started on things. I&#39;ve had people tell me that they think I&#39;m superhumanly productive, which is funny to me: I&#39;m almost constantly fretting about how much time I waste every day. And while I do have a ton of projects, unlike all those guys, I tend to not fully finish them. It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve been trying to work on lately, because I have so many things that I want to accomplish.</div> <p /><div>For me, the biggest hold on cranking out even more stuff is just simply starting to work. Often, if i slack off for half an hour, I slack off all evening. Now that there&#39;s a TV with Netflix in my house again, it&#39;s difficult to not watch all of the amazing documentaries that are on there. But if I manage to start working on stuff, I find that I keep doing it. It&#39;s like I get to pick one or the other: projects or slacking. I can&#39;t quite seem to do both. And so I&#39;ve been starting some minor experimentation to see if I can&#39;t work on projects more often than not.</div> <p /><div>One thing that I&#39;ve sort of half-tried is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>. It&#39;s pretty sweet: basically, you set a timer for 25 minutes, and start working. You can take a break when it goes off. Surely you can wait to refresh Hacker News for 25 minutes, right? That&#39;s something else I&#39;ve done: on Friday, I put Reddit and HN in my /etc/hosts file. They&#39;re totally blocked, for now. After <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/trouble-with-diaspora">last week&#39;s situation</a>, I spent waaaay too much freaking time on HN, even for me. I love it, and I&#39;m learning a ton every day, but it&#39;s becoming an issue for my productivity. So it&#39;s gone for a bit. It&#39;s been rough, but I&#39;ve been getting lots done, and I think when I start reading it again, I&#39;ll be able to keep it at reasonable levels.</div> <p /><div>Anyway, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing to keep productive. Anyone else have any thoughts on this? How do you keep working on side projects? What works for you?</div>
