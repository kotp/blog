Whew.

If you've been [following me on Twitter][1] at all lately, you'll know that
I've been working hard on a new project lately. Tonight, even though it's
late, I'm finally getting it out there. Please welcome [http://rstat.us/][2]
to the world! (as soon as the DNS updates. ;) )

[rstat.us][3] is a micro-blogging service, just like Twitter. There's one big
difference, though: it is distributed. Oh, and it's 100% open source. So two
things. It's also integrated with Facebook and Twitter, so you can just log in
with either of those accounts, and it'll syndicate your posts. Well, just to
Twitter right now, but we're getting there.

Here's the other cool thing: Want to own your data? You can actually [get the
code][4] and run a copy yourself! But you won't get left out: you can follow
anyone else that uses the [ostatus][5] protocol, like [http://identi.ca/][6],
and it'll Just Work. You just have to grab the URL to their feed, put it in,
and it's all good! But you probably shouldn't do that yet. We're still working
on some features.

[rstat.us][3] is still very much alpha quality. 7 or 8 of my best friends and
I have been fighting off sleep, food, and tests for the last two weeks to put
this together. Please [give it a try][2] and let me know what you think, tell
me if you can break it, or anything else that's particularly interesting. If
you're the coding type, please check out the [wiki][7] for a big old list of
stuff we'd like to do.

Oh, and of course, you should [follow me on rstat.us][8].
