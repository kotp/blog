title: I'm quitting Hacker News
layout: post
---
I&#39;ve been thinking about this post for a while.<p /><div>I freaking love Hacker News. It&#39;s my favorite place on the Internet. It&#39;s incredibly valuable. I have learned so much from my time there.  With that said, I feel like it&#39;s taken up too much of my time.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m trying to accomplish things. I got accepted to grad school. I&#39;m trying to rebuild Shoes. I&#39;m working on improving Hackety. I&#39;m finding that I don&#39;t have enough hours in the day to accomplish the things I want to accomplish. And arguing for the hundredth time about how artists will survive in a post-IP world, or how to get your first couple of users, or whatever it is that Google or Apple did this week hasn&#39;t gotten boring yet, and that&#39;s a problem.</div> <p /><div>The only respectable solution is to go cold-turkey for a while.</div><p /><div>I&#39;ve been doing good on some of my new years&#39; resolutions, and bad on others. I haven&#39;t spent a lot of time writing lately, and I have only been doing okay at my writing. Hacker News is cutting into that. I feel like I&#39;m using it in the same way some use TV. Yeah, it&#39;s significantly deeper, but I really should be reading more books and less HN. At least, that&#39;s what&#39;s right for me right now.</div> <p /><div>I won&#39;t be gone forever. I just need to spend more time elsewhere.</div><p /><div>With that said, I&#39;ve been spending a _lot_ of time on Shoes. I&#39;ll just leave this here: <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify">https://github.com/shoes/shoes/tree/feature/gemify</a></div>
