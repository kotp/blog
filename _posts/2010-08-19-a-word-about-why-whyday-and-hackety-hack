title: "A word about _why, #whyday , and Hackety Hack"
layout: post
---
<p>Today is Whyday. A programmer's holiday. Today is the day that we <br />don't forget that programming isn't all Agile and driven by behavior <br />and Serious Business. Inside each cubicle, the hacker spirit is trying <br />to burst free. Today, it will. <p /> Today, I'm also releasing a prerelease version of Hackety Hack 1.0. <br />It's been a long time coming. The announcement of Whyday got me <br />thinking about the past year of a world without _why, and the 'your <br />domain is about to expire' notices got me thinking about how I've now <br />been the head of the Hackety Hack project for almost 12 months, too. I <br />don't like thinking about this, because I almost let _why down. <p /> I never met _why. I can't really claim to know him, or know what his <br />intentions were, but I think about him a lot. '_why' the persona, <br />really embodies everything that I love about software. The world owes <br />_why a great debt, and I'd like to think that I'm doing what I can to <br />repay him. <p /> At least, I am now. I don't like to think about roughly 6 or 8 months <br />of the last year of Hackety Hack; I did an exceptionally poor job of <br />being a steward. Being alone, having no help, and having a bit of an <br />identity crisis is an excuse; you can decide if it's a good or poor <br />one. But things have been looking up, and we've got some momentum, I <br />owe a great debt to Fela for helping make this summer happen. <p /> I really do feel that the Little Coder still has a predicament, and <br />I'm almost to the point where they can find some solace. I still feel <br />that Hackety Hack could become an absolutely invauable project, I've <br />just got to keep going. I can, I will, and I am. But I wouldn't be <br />able to if so many people didn't care, say a nice world, or lend a <br />hand. <p /> So thanks. And as ashbb would say, "Let's all have fun with Hackety Hack!" <p /> Happy Whyday.</p>
