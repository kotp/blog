title: I'm Making It Dead Simple To Contribute To Ruby's Documentation
layout: post

Okay! So, if you'd read [my previous article on
this](/2011/05/10/contributing-to-ruby-s-documentation.html), you'd know how
easy it is to contribute to Ruby's Documentaiton.

> But Steve, I'm _still_ kinda scared.

Okay, so here we go: I'm making it even easier on you.

Send me what you want changed, and how, and I'll make a patch and submit
it on your behalf.

No, seriously, I will. I already did once. [This guy](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/38873) posted something about how it was too hard, [so
I made a patch for him](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/38875). And now Ruby is better because of it.

And so I'll do it again. Scared to deal with doc patches? I'll make them
up. I'm serious. I'll do it. Send them to me.

That's all.

Send me patches.
[steve@steveklabnik.com](mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com). Do it.
