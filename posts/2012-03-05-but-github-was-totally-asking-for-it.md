I wrote a bunch of stuff here, but some people were uncomfortable with it, so
I'm playing it safe and just removing everything but the TL;DR. I was concerned
about what I wrote, but I have no way of getting feedback on this particular
topic other than pushing publish, so...

TL;DR: Victim blaming is always bad, no matter what the situation. It's never
a victim's fault when bad things happen to them. It is always the aggressor's
fault. Stop blaming victims.
